## Technologies Used

This project leverages a modern web development stack:

* **Next.js**: A powerful React Framework enabling Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Static Site Generation (SSG), and API routes for high performance and SEO.
* **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static type definitions, enhancing code quality, readability, and maintainability. It's crucial for component props (e.g., `children: React.ReactNode`) and general code reliability.
* **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development directly in your markup without writing custom CSS.
* **MDX**: Allows you to write Markdown with embedded JSX components. This is used for dynamic content like blog posts and books, enabling rich, interactive content.
* **gray-matter**: Library for parsing front matter from Markdown files.

---

## Content Management

Content for the website is organized as follows:

* **Blogs**: Markdown/MDX files located directly in the `/posts` directory at the project root.
* **Books**: Markdown/MDX files located directly in the `/books` directory at the project root.
* **Images**: Blog post cover images are typically in `/public/images/blog`. Other general images and logos are under `/public/assets/images`.
* **Static Files**: Downloadable assets (e.g., PDFs, EPUBs) are placed under `/public/downloads`.

---

## Deployment

The project is designed for seamless deployment on various platforms.

### Recommended Platforms

* **Vercel**: Offers native and optimized support for Next.js applications, providing easy continuous deployment.
* **Netlify**: A popular platform for deploying static sites and frontends, offering robust build and deployment features.

### CI/CD Setup Considerations

* Ensure the `.next` cache is cleared during build steps to prevent stale data issues.
* Properly configure any environment variables required for the application (e.g., API keys).

## Troubleshooting Common Build Errors

If you encounter `npm run build` failures, especially after making changes to components or pages, these are common issues and their solutions:

1.  **`Module not found: Can't resolve 'react/jsx-runtime'`**
    * **Symptom:** Build fails with errors related to `react/jsx-runtime` or `react/jsx-dev-runtime`.
    * **Reason:** This can be a complex Next.js internal resolution issue, sometimes related to specific versions or build environments.
    * **Solution:** Add Webpack aliases in your `next.config.js` to explicitly guide module resolution.
        ```javascript
        // next.config.js
        const path = require('path');

        module.exports = {
          webpack: (config, { isServer }) => {
            config.resolve.alias = {
              ...config.resolve.alias,
              'react/jsx-runtime.js': path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/react/jsx-runtime.js'),
              'react/jsx-dev-runtime.js': path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/react/jsx-dev-runtime.js'),
            };
            return config;
          },
        };
        ```
    * After modifying `next.config.js`, run `npm install` again to ensure dependencies are in sync, then `npm run build`.

2.  **`ENOENT: no such file or directory, scandir '/opt/build/repo/posts'` (or `/books`) on CI/CD**
    * **Symptom:** Local build works, but CI/CD (e.g., Netlify) fails with "no such file or directory" errors for your `posts` or `books` folders.
    * **Reason:** Git does not track empty directories by default. If your `posts` or `books` directories were empty when committed, Git ignored them, and they aren't present in the build environment.
    * **Solution:** Add a `.gitkeep` file (or any other dummy file) inside each of these directories to force Git to track them.
        * Navigate to your project root in the terminal.
        * Create `.gitkeep` files:
            ```bash
            echo > posts/.gitkeep
            echo > books/.gitkeep
            ```
            (On macOS/Linux, you might use `touch posts/.gitkeep` and `touch books/.gitkeep`)
        * Add, commit, and push these changes to your Git repository:
            ```bash
            git add .
            git commit -m "feat: Add .gitkeep files to content directories for deployment"
            git push origin main
            ```

3.  **`ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.../.gitkeep.md'` or Parsing Errors on `.gitkeep`**
    * **Symptom:** After adding `.gitkeep` files, your build fails when trying to read/parse `.gitkeep` as a Markdown file, typically with "no such file or directory, open `.../.gitkeep.md`" or "malformed front matter."
    * **Reason:** Your content-fetching logic (e.g., in `lib/posts.ts`) is trying to read *all* files in the `posts` (or `books`) directory, including the `.gitkeep` placeholder, as if they were valid Markdown posts.
    * **Solution:** Modify your `getPostSlugs` (or equivalent) function to filter out non-Markdown files before processing them.
        * Open `lib/posts.ts`.
        * Locate the `getPostSlugs` function.
        * Add a `.filter()` method to only include files ending with `.md` or `.mdx`:
            ```typescript
            // lib/posts.ts (excerpt)
            import fs from 'fs';
            import path from 'path';

            const postsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), 'posts');

            export function getPostSlugs(): string[] {
              return fs.readdirSync(postsDirectory)
                .filter(fileName => fileName.endsWith('.md') || fileName.endsWith('.mdx')) // ADD THIS LINE
                .map(fileName => fileName.replace(/\.mdx?$/, ''));
            }
            ```
        * Save the file, run `npm run build` locally, and then commit and push if successful.

4.  **Verify `Layout` Component Usage:**
    * **Symptom 1: `Type error: Cannot find name 'Layout'.`**
        * **Reason:** The `Layout` component isn't being correctly imported or found by TypeScript.
        * **Solution:**
            * Confirm `components/Layout.tsx` exists and is correctly exporting its default function: `export default function Layout(...) { ... }`.
            * Verify the **exact relative import path** in the problematic page file. For pages directly under `/pages` (e.g., `pages/about.tsx`), use `import Layout from '../components/Layout';`. For pages nested deeper (e.g., `pages/blog/[slug].tsx`), use `import Layout from '../../components/Layout';`.
            * Ensure `components/Layout.tsx` includes `import React from 'react';` for `React.ReactNode` type.
    * **Symptom 2: `Type error: Property 'children' is missing in type '{}' but required in type '{ children: ReactNode; }'.`**
        * **Reason:** The `Layout` component requires `children` (content) inside its tags, but somewhere it's being rendered without any content, like `<Layout></Layout>`.
        * **Solution:** For *every* page that uses `Layout`, ensure there is **always content nested within the `<Layout>` tags**. Even an empty `<div>` or a React Fragment (`<></>`) is sufficient:
            ```jsx
            // Correct usage: Content is wrapped
            <Layout>
              <div>
                {/* Your page content */}
              </div>
            </Layout>
            ```
        * This applies to all pages: `index.js`, `about.tsx`, `blog/index.tsx`, `blog/[slug].tsx`, `books/index.tsx`, `books/[slug].tsx`, `brands.tsx`, `contact.tsx`, and any custom error pages like `404.tsx`.

5.  **Check `return` Statement Syntax in Pages:**
    * **Symptom: `Type error: ')' expected.`**
        * **Reason:** When a React functional component returns JSX that spans multiple lines, the JSX *must* be enclosed in parentheses `()`.
        * **Solution:** Always structure your component's return statement like this:
            ```typescript
            export default function MyPage() {
              return ( // <--- Add this opening parenthesis if missing
                <Layout>
                  {/* ... all your multi-line JSX content ... */}
                </Layout>
              ); // <--- Add this closing parenthesis and semicolon if missing
            }
            ```

6.  **Confirm `.tsx` and `.js` File Extensions:**
    * Ensure all files intended to be TypeScript components or pages are named `.tsx` (or `.ts` for non-JSX files like utilities). Regular JavaScript files should remain `.js`. Mismatched extensions can cause import/resolution issues.

7.  **Review Console for Specific File Paths and Line Numbers:**
    * Always pay close attention to the error messages in your terminal. They provide precise file paths and line numbers, which are your best guide to locating and fixing the issue.

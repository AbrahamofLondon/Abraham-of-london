After one quiet, brutal surrender, he vows: **love will not make me smaller**.\n\nLondon throws him **Mara Solace** (South African-British), a producer with a steel spine and a sunlit laugh. She makes plans **and** room for God. She doesn’t do maybes.\n\nThey make a beautiful mistake: a **contract romance**—clear clauses, weekly retros, healthy guardrails. It works… until it doesn’t. The city whispers. History knocks. Desire collides with discipline. Their fortress becomes their test.\n\n**Can two tacticians trained to fight alone, finally stand together?**\n\n---\n\n## Logline\n\nA brilliant London strategist must dismantle the walls that kept him safe—or lose the only woman who can match his courage, his faith, and his standards.\n\n---\n\n## Series Snapshot (Streaming-ready)\n\n- **Format:** Limited series, **8×45**  \n- **Tone:** Romantic dramedy with prestige edges — witty, soulful, a little dangerous  \n- **Vibe:** *Bridgerton*’s swoon meets *The Bear*’s discipline, with *Modern Love*’s grounded heart  \n- **Setting:** Multicultural London — Canary Wharf glass, Brixton nights, Thames-path kitchens, Peckham salons, Hampstead quiet  \n- **Rating:** TV-14/MA border (mature themes, restrained intimacy, no gratuitous content)  \n- **Hooks:** Contract romance • healthy consent that’s actually hot • “faith practiced, not performed” • big-city family/community  \n- **Audience Promise:** Smart banter, slow-burn chemistry, grown-up boundaries, and emotional payoff\n\n---\n\n## Core Cast (Colourful, modern, London)\n\n- **Davidson Adeyemi — “The Architect.”** Nigerian-British, eldest-son gravity, immaculate notebooks; brilliant at structure, apprenticing himself to feeling.  \n- **Mara Solace — “The Producer.”** South African-British, warm and exact; faith as craft, boundaries as tools, agenda in Notes app.  \n- **Emmanuel Grant — “The Mirror.”** Jamaican-British counsellor-in-training; Davidson’s oldest friend, the one who spots hairline fractures.  \n- **Sera Dlamini — “The Seer.”** Mara’s producing partner (Eswatini roots); romantic with a cynic’s eye, allergic to cheap spectacle.  \n- **Auntie Funmi Adeyemi.** Matriarch, runs a Peckham salon, reads people like receipts.  \n- **Rabbi Cohen.** Downstairs neighbour who waters plants and wisdom.  \n- **Ayo & Nandi.** The pray-then-play church couple who host loud dinners and quiet salvations.\n\n> **Representation note:** The cast mirrors London’s real streets—African, Caribbean, Jewish, South Asian, Eastern European—without tokenism. Faith appears as **practice** (meals, prayers, mercy), not performance.\n\n---\n\n## Season One Arc (High-appeal beats)\n\n1) **The Agreement** — They design a relationship with check-ins, exits, and a “retro” ritual. Sparks through spreadsheets.  \n2) **The Breach** — A past promise returns; a boundary is tested; the city (and group chat) watches.  \n3) **Consent as Chemistry** — Desire by blueprint: adult, exact, slow. Saying “not yet” makes **now** stronger.  \n4) **Proximity** — Long days, longer stares; rumours fly; they choose presence over performance.  \n5) **The Mirror Clause** — Public table read. Subtext everywhere. Repair is practiced, not performed.  \n6) **Witness** — A Friday-night dinner where faith is a verb; kindness with an edge.  \n7) **Public Offering** — Viral misread; brand deals to sell the “cute couple.” They refuse the counterfeit.  \n8) **Standards** — Deadline hits. Not perfect—**decided**.

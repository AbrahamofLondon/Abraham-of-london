Jesus wasn’t advertising ultra-luxury real estate in the sky. He was making a **covenant promise** to anxious disciples: *you will never be homeless in My Father’s household*.\n\n<Rule />\n\n## The Word: *Monē* Means “Room,” Not “Mansion”\n\nThe Greek word is **μονή (*monē*)** — *dwelling place, room, an abode*.\nIn John 14:23 it’s used again of the Father and the Son **making their home** with the believer. The old English “mansions” drifted in via the Latin *mansiones* (stopping-places) and our imaginations did the rest.\n\n<PullLine>\n  Jesus was speaking about **abiding**, not **upgrading**.\n</PullLine>\n\n<Rule />\n\n## The House: *Oikos* Is Family, Not Square Footage\n\nWhen Jesus says “My Father’s house,” think **household** (*oikos*) — the family estate where sons added rooms when they married.\n\nIn first-century Israel the groom returned to the father’s home to **prepare a room** for his bride, then came back to **bring her in**. That’s the template Jesus gives:\n\n<PullLine subtle>\n  *I’m the Bridegroom. I’m preparing space for you in My Father’s household. I will come and take you to Myself.*\n</PullLine>\n\n<Rule />\n\n## The Comfort: Presence Over Possessions\n\nThe disciples were rattled because Jesus was leaving. He doesn’t soothe them with status. He anchors them with **presence and permanence**:\n\n- **Prepared** — your place is secured by the cross, the empty tomb, and the ascension.\n- **Personal** — *“that where I am, you may be also.”*\n- **Plentiful** — “many rooms” means **no believer is turned away**.\n\nHe wasn’t feeding greed. He was **answering fear**.\n\n<Rule />\n\n## The Descent That Secures Our Room\n\nOur assurance rests on the humility of Christ:\n\n<Verse cite=\"Philippians 2:5–11\">\n  Though He was in the form of God… He emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant… becoming obedient to death—even death on a cross.\n</Verse>\n\nThe One who **had the place** made Himself **place-less** — born as a helpless child, condemned as a criminal — so we could be **placed** forever in the Father’s home. Our value is measured not by our strategy or polish, but by the **love and grace** of Christ.\n\n<Rule />\n\n## Legacy That Endures\n\n<PullLine>\n  True legacy is **life with Jesus**. Everything we fashion on earth — wealth, reputation, even our best frameworks — cannot rival one prepared room in the Father’s house.\n</PullLine>\n\nSo:\n\n- Hold **strategy** lightly and **Saviour** tightly.\n- Build what lasts **here**, while belonging **there**.\n- Refuse counterfeit comfort; choose the **real comfort** of promised presence.\n\n<Rule />\n\n## Practise the Hope\n\n<Note tone=\"key\" title=\"A Simple Rule (Weekly)\">\n1) **Pray your fears out loud.** The promise was given to frightened friends; it still steadies anxious hearts.\n2) **Live household-first.** Church previews that future home; make room for one another.\n3) **Aim for likeness, not ladders.** If the Groom is humble, the bride must be too.\n</Note>\n\n<PullLine subtle>\n  *NB (with a smile): We’re not loitering at the gates; we’re welcomed **inside** the Father’s home, forever.*\n</PullLine>\n\n<Rule />\n\n## Final Word\n\nJesus didn’t promise **mansions**; He promised **home**. The Bridegroom will return. The household has room. And because He descended, we will dwell — with Him — **always**.\n\n<Note tone=\"key\" title=\"Small Group Liturgy (60–90s)\">\n  **Leader:** Where are we headed?\n  **All:** Home — in the Father’s house.\n\n  **Leader:** Who prepares our place?\n  **All:** Jesus, the Bridegroom.\n\n  **Leader:** What secures our welcome?\n  **All:** His cross and His resurrection.\n\n  **Leader:** What name do we live under now?\n  **All:** Sons and daughters in God’s household.\n\n  **Leader:** What do we fear?\n  **All:** Not scarcity — there are many rooms.\n\n  **Leader:** How shall we live until He comes?\n  **All:** Humble, holy, and hospitable.\n\n  **Leader:** Come, Lord Jesus.

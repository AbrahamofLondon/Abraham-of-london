Honour your mother. Tell the truth. Own mistakes.\nChoose brothers who sharpen you. Work before reward. Discipline your body. Master money.\nProtect the vulnerable. Build altars at home. Live sent.\n\n<Callout tone=\"key\" title=\"One action today\">\n  Choose one principle and make it visible: write it on a card, set a phone reminder, or speak it at the dinner table.\n</Callout>\n\n<Rule />\n\n## I. Identity & Integrity\n\n1. **Fear God, not man.** Reverence produces wisdom; popularity produces compromise.\n2. **Guard your mind.** Attention is stewardship—protect it from cheap stimuli and lazy thinking.\n3. **Honour your mother.** Strength never requires disrespect.\n4. **Tell the truth.** Even when it stings. *Especially then.*\n5. **Own your mistakes.** Repent quickly. Don’t hide—**heal**.\n\n<Verse cite=\"Proverbs 1:7\">The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge.</Verse>\n\n<Rule />\n\n## II. Discipline & Development\n\n6. **Choose your brothers.** Community builds or breaks destiny—pick men who **sharpen** you.\n7. **Work before reward.** Excellence sows first; harvest comes later.\n8. **Discipline your body.** Sleep, movement, food—habits build a future your feelings can’t sabotage.\n9. **Master money.** Save, give, invest. Never worship what you’re called to steward.\n\n<Note tone=\"info\" title=\"Daily micro-rule (10 minutes)\">\n  3 push-ups $\\times$ 10, 2 glasses of water, 5 verses aloud, 60-second room reset.

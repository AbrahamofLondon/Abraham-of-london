Your name is Father. Act like it.\n</PullLine>\n\n<Rule />\n\n## Myths to Reject\n\n- **“Absent means uninterested.”** *Sometimes it means obstructed.*\n- **“A good dad is a quiet dad.”** *False. Healthy fathers are present, principled, and documented.*\n- **“Play nice and it will sort itself out.”** *Clarity isn’t cruelty; boundaries aren’t bitterness.*\n\n<Note tone=\"caution\" title=\"Watch the framing\">\n  **“He didn’t attend”** *vs* **“He was not informed.”**\n  **“He’s angry”** *vs* **“He’s protective and asked for safeguarding.”**\n  Accurate language matters — now and later.\n</Note>\n\n<Rule />\n\n## The Child's Core Need: Why the Fight Matters\n\nIt is difficult to pursue a stable relationship when faced with **parental obstacles, system bias, and the impossible hurdles of family court**. However, this fight is not about your rights; it is about your child's innate need for a stable foundation.\n\nYour children are stuck in the middle of a conflict they did not choose. They deserve more than just access; they deserve your commitment to making their already difficult circumstances:\n\n- **Consistent:** A dependable pattern of connection and interaction.\n- **Reliable:** Knowing you will show up, even when it is hard.\n- **Predictable:** A stable, loving, and supportive relationship with **both** parents.\n\nThis pursuit of a reliable presence **is your highest form of advocacy**. Your fight is the proof of your value in their life.\n\n<PullLine>\n  When the system makes connection difficult, your consistency becomes a matter of moral necessity.\n</PullLine>\n\n<Rule />\n\n## What to Document (consistently)\n\n**You can’t fight for truth without receipts.** Maintain rigorous records:\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Category</th>\n      <th>Documentation Focus (Facts, not Feelings)</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>**Time &amp; Communication**</td><td>Dates, calls, messages, missed time, refused access.</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>**Involvement**</td><td>School runs, homework, meetings, medical and extracurriculars.</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>**Financial Support**</td><td>All receipts and bank records.

Assume everything is disclosable.\n\n<Note tone=\"key\" title=\"The B.P.F. rule\">\n  **Brief • Polite • Factual.** Four to six sentences and one clear ask.\n  If the matter is complex, acknowledge and move to an email. Summarise calmly.\n</Note>\n\n<Rule />\n\n## Court-Day Cadence (5 minutes)\n\n- **Breathe:** Box-breathe $4\\times4\\times4\\times4$.\n- **Pray:** “Jesus, carry me — I choose trust.”\n- **Repeat:** Your three headlines out loud.\n- **Decide:** Your one specific, child-focused ask for today.\n\n<Verse cite=\"Philippians 4:6–7\">\n  …by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God will guard your hearts and minds…\n</Verse>\n\n<Rule />\n\n## What to Tell Your Son\n\n<PullLine>\n  You’re loved. I’m not leaving.

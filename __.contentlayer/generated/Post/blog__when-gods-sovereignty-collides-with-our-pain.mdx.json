We are raising children in a world where **truth is constantly on trial**.\n\n- Lies shape institutions.\n- Lies set norms.\n- Lies stand unless someone contests them with clarity and charity.\n\n<Note tone=\"key\" title=\"The Father’s Engagement\">\n  **How do we fight without being deformed by the fight?**\n  **How do we engage culture without losing the family we’re fighting for?**\n</Note>\n\n<Rule />\n\n## Personal Brush With Death (Why I’m Not Theorising)\n\nI’ve stared death in the face:\n\n- A bullet at a student protest missed me and killed the bus driver behind me.\n- I’ve left my body, seen my family weep, then returned.\n- I’ve been warned in seconds and pulled out of danger.\n\nI’ve buried three sisters, two brothers, my father, my childhood friend Waidi, and my best brother David.\nLoss is not theory; it’s biography. And still I’ve clung to God’s faithfulness — even when another man’s death shakes me differently.\n\n<Rule />\n\n## The Overlap We Live In\n\nScripture names Satan “the god of this world” (*2 Corinthians 4:4*), and yet Christ has triumphed at the cross. So which is it?\n\n<Verse cite=\"John 16:33\">\n  “In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.”\n</Verse>\n\nWe live in the **already/not-yet**: Christ has **overcome** (already) and we still face **tribulation** (not yet ended). Sovereignty doesn’t erase sorrow; it **locates** it inside a larger victory.\n\n<Rule />\n\n## God’s Justice vs. Our Sense of Justice\n\nI know Job’s reply — **we cannot fathom** — but God also invites reasoning. He calls us to **seek**, **knock**, and **wrestle**.\n\nSo I’m honest before Him:\n\n- I’m not afraid of death.\n- I’m not doubting eternity.\n- I’m asking: **Is this truly the better story You’re writing — even when it feels cruel?**\n\nBiblically, His goodness is not the absence of pain; it’s His presence and purpose **through** it.\nAt the cross, **injustice became salvation**. That doesn’t trivialise grief; it dignifies it with meaning.\n\n<Verse cite=\"Romans 8:28\">\n  “We know that for those who love God all things work together for good…”\n</Verse>\n\n<Rule />\n\n## Praxis for Fathers Under Sovereignty\n\n**Sovereignty** is not an excuse for passivity; it’s a foundation for **holy agency**.\n\n1. **Hold your post.** In your home, church, and city — show up with order and compassion.\n2. **Guard your mouth.** Truth without kindness is brutality; kindness without truth is weakness.\n3. **Build receipts.** Live so your life, logs, and witnesses preach louder than allegations.\n4. **Pray and plan.** Intercession + intelligent action is how faith *works*.\n5. **Protect your margin.** Sleep, Scripture, sweat, sunlight, support — the habits that keep you usable.\n\n<Note tone=\"key\" title=\"A 60-Second Daily Prayer\">\n  Father, I trust Your wisdom when mine fails.\n  Jesus, govern my words today; make me brave and gentle.\n  Holy Spirit, steady my emotions and guide my steps. Amen.\n</Note>\n\n<Rule />\n\n## When the Night Feels Long (Four Anchors)\n\n- **Lament is holy.** Psalms give you language; use it.\n- **Community is oxygen.** Don’t bleed alone — text a brother, join the prayer.\n- **Work the small orders.** Make the bed, clear the sink, send the kind email.\n- **Speak life aloud.** Over your child, your case, your city.\n\n<PullLine subtle>\n  Suffering is not your identity. **Sonship is.**\n</PullLine>\n\n<Rule />\n\n## For Group Study (4 Questions)\n\n1. Where does God’s sovereignty comfort you — and where does it offend you?\n2. Which habit helps you resist despair most: prayer, planning, or brotherhood? Why?\n3. Where are you tempted to “win online” but lose at home?\n4. What one act of faithfulness will your children feel this week?\n\n<Rule />\n\n## Final Word\n\nI don’t have all the answers. But I know this:\n\n<PullLine>\n  **Truth matters because lies destroy.**\n  **Fathers must engage — even when we bleed.**\n</PullLine>\n\n<ResourcesCTA\n  title=\"Keep Building — Reading & Tools\"\n  reads={[\n    { href: \"/blog/when-the-system-breaks-you\", label: \"When the System Breaks You\", sub: \"Grief • Grit • Grace\" },\n    { href: \"/blog/fathering-without-fear\", label: \"Fathering Without Fear — A Memoir\", sub: \"Movement, not just story\" },\n    { href: \"/blog/leadership-begins-at-home\", label: \"Leadership Begins at Home\", sub: \"Order over noise\" }\n  ]}\n  downloads={[\n    { href: \"/downloads/Communication_Script_BPF.pdf\", label: \"Brief • Polite • Factual Scripts\" },\n    { href: \"/downloads/Leadership_Playbook.pdf\", label: \"Leadership Playbook (30–60–90)\" },\n    { href: \"/downloads/Entrepreneur_Operating_Pack.pdf\", label: \"Weekly Operating Rhythm\" }\n  ]}\n/>\n\n<ShareRow\n  text=\"Sovereignty isn’t passivity.

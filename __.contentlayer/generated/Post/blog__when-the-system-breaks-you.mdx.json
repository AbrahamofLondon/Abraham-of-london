A righteous response to injustice:\n\n- **Restores agency:** You still command tone, time, and testimony.\n- **Protects family:** Boundaries are love in hard weather.\n- **Builds witness:** Steady integrity outlives noisy narratives.\n\n> **Aim:** Present fathers who govern themselves and bless their children under fire.\n\n---\n\n## The Three Rooms (Scaffold of Presence)\n1. **Grief.** Name losses. **Lament is holy.** Write one page: _what was taken / what remains_. Tears prove love.\n2. **Grit.** Daily rule: sleep · Scripture · sweat · sunlight · support. **30 days.** Miss? Restart—no drama.\n3. **Grace.** Forgive wisely; keep **boundaries firm**.

No adjectives; no sarcasm.\n- File docs in one cloud folder: `YYYY-MM-DD_topic.pdf`.\n- Pray Psalm 23 or Romans 8:31–39 aloud. Then stop scrolling.\n\n**Weekly (40–50 mins)**\n- Review log → extract **facts / asks / deadlines**.\n- Draft one calm, factual update/request if needed.\n- Ask a trusted friend to check tone before sending.\n\n<Note tone=\"caution\" title=\"Red flags to avoid\">\n  CAPS LOCK, threats, diagnosing the other party, late-night essays, and posting case details online.\n  These don’t help you—they **feed the wrong narrative**.\n</Note>\n\n<Rule />\n\n## A Father’s Rule of Life (battle edition)\n**Morning**\n- **Word:** one psalm + one Gospel paragraph.\n- **Body:** 10–15 minutes sweat (walk, push-ups, stretches).\n- **Order:** bed made, dishes cleared—prove to your brain you bring order.\n\n**Midday reset (3 mins)**\n- Box-breathing $4\\times4\\times4\\times4$.\n- “Father, shepherd my heart; govern my mouth.”\n\n**Evening**\n- Five-line gratitude: God / your child / your growth / two for tomorrow’s priorities.\n\n> **“Do not be anxious about anything… and the peace of God will guard your hearts and minds.”**\n> — *Philippians 4:6–7*\n\n<Rule />\n\n## Co-Parenting Under Pressure (principles that travel)\n- **Child-first lens.** Ask: “What serves the child’s stability next week?”\n- **Boundaries ≠ hostility.** Communicate briefly, politely, factually.\n- **Offer solutions.** “Wed 17:00–19:00 or Sat 10:00–12:00.

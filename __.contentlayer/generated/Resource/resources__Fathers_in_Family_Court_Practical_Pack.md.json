This is not legal advice.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Evidence Checklist — “Receipts or it didn’t happen”\n- **Time & Communication:** dates, times, channels, missed/shortened contact, refusals.\n- **Parenting Involvement:** homework help, school runs, parent evenings, medical appointments.\n- **Financial Support:** bank statements, receipts, transfers, reference notes.\n- **Third-Party Notes:** teacher/coach confirmations, church leaders, childminders.\n- **Interference / Obstruction:** late cancellations, withheld info, contradictory statements (facts only).\n- **File Hygiene:** one cloud folder; filenames like `YYYY-MM-DD_topic.ext`.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Court-Prep Checklist (48–72 hours before)\n- Confirm hearing details: time, court, judge (if known), room, remote link.\n- Compile **bundle** (or your organised pack): order, paginate, table of contents.\n- Print/prepare **3 copies** of key exhibits (you, other side, court).\n- Draft **3 headline points** tied to *best interests of the child*.\n- Outfit ready (smart, neutral), travel plan + buffer, childcare cover.\n- Tech check for remote hearings (quiet space, headphones, battery).\n\n---\n\n## 3) “B.P.F.” Rule for Communications\n- **Brief** — keep to the point; 4–6 sentences max.\n- **Polite** — neutral tone; no blame adjectives.\n- **Factual** — who/what/when/where; a single clear *ask* with deadline.\n\n**Template (after missed contact):**\n> “At 18:40 on 12/10, pick-up at Elm Street did not occur. I waited until 19:05.\n> I propose alternatives this week: Wed 18:00 or Fri 18:00 at the same location.\n> Please confirm by 12:00 tomorrow which you prefer.”\n\n---\n\n## 4) Witness & Community Support\n- Ask teachers/coaches for **short factual notes**: attendance, punctuality, engagement.\n- Line up a **character reference** (work/faith leader) — 1 page, facts + examples.\n- Keep supporters off social media commentary; they harm more than help.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Online & Messaging Hygiene\n- No late-night texts; no rants; no diagnosing the other party.\n- Turn off read-receipts if it fuels conflict. Screenshot important threads.\n- Never post case details online. Assume all messages will be read in court.\n\n---\n\n## 6) Day-of-Court Grounding (5 minutes)\n- Box breathing $4\\times4\\times4\\times4$ for 1 minute.\n- Prayer (choose one):\n  - “Jesus, carry me — I choose trust.”\n  - “Set a guard over my mouth; give me mercy and steel.”\n- Repeat your **3 headline points** out loud.\n- Decide your “one ask” today (specific, child-focused).\n\n---\n\n## 7) Sample Letter — Factual, Child-First\nTo Whom It May Concern,\n\nI am the father of [Child’s Name, DOB]. I am writing to provide a brief factual summary relevant to contact arrangements.\n\n- I have attended [list key school/medical events] between [dates].\n- I provide [weekly/fortnightly] financial support of [amount]; evidence attached.\n- Contact has occurred on [X of Y scheduled occasions] over the last [period].\n- On [dates], contact did not occur due to [brief factual reason if known].\n\n**Request:** I propose the following contact pattern in the child’s best interests:\n- [e.g., Wednesday 17:00–19:00 handover at X; Saturday 10:00–14:00 at Y]\nI am available to adjust logistics to support schooling, rest, and routine.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name] — [Phone] — [Email]\n\n---\n\n## 8) Post-Hearing Debrief (that evening)\n- Write 10 lines: outcomes, deadlines, next steps, emotions (for processing only).\n- Email yourself the note; add tasks to calendar.\n- Do one act of presence for your child: read, call, record a 60-second voice note.\n\n---\n\n**Remember:** Court rewards clarity. Children thrive on consistency. Your job is both.",

## The Cycle We Inherited

I see it everywhere—in the parking lots of private schools, in the exhausted faces at corporate offices, in the silent dinners where fathers sit as strangers at their own tables. We've inherited a broken blueprint, one that taught us love equals provision, that a good father is measured by what he can buy rather than who he chooses to be.

Our fathers weren't villains. They were heroes trapped in a tragic misunderstanding. They sacrificed their presence for our provision, trading bedtime stories for overtime hours, missing baseball games to pay for better equipment. They gave us everything they thought we needed, except the one thing we needed most: **them**.

The cruel irony? By the time they could afford the life they wanted to give us, we had already learned to live without them in it.

## The Truth We Must Face

**Truth #1: Good intentions don't heal generational wounds.**  
Your father may have worked 80-hour weeks out of love, but that doesn't erase the loneliness you felt waiting for him to come home. His sacrifice doesn't automatically heal your abandonment. Honoring his intentions while acknowledging your pain isn't contradictory—it's necessary.

**Truth #2: Provision without presence breeds emotional poverty.**  
We can give our children every advantage money can buy, but if we're not emotionally available, we're raising wealthy orphans. The most expensive gift means nothing if it comes from a father who's become a stranger.

**Truth #3: The cycle repeats because we've never learned to break it.**  
We inherit not just our father's genes, but their coping mechanisms, their blind spots, their unhealed wounds. Without conscious intervention, we become the fathers

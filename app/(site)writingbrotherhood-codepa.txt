            Absent fathers are not replaced by louder politics or Twitter debate. They are replaced by <strong>present men</strong>—men who <strong>show up</strong> consistently, act with <strong>integrity</strong>, and build <strong>brotherhoods</strong> anchored in truth and service.
          </p>

          <blockquote>

          </blockquote>

          <p><strong>Brotherhood is not a chat thread. It is a covenant of presence.</strong></p>

          <hr />

          <h2>TL;DR — Run This</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Gather <strong>3–5 men</strong> you respect.</li>
            <li>Commit to a <strong>90-day pilot</strong> with a weekly meeting.</li>
            <li>Adopt the <strong>Covenant of Presence</strong> (below).</li>
            <li>Follow the <strong>60–90 min rhythm</strong> (Scripture → Formation → Intercession).</li>
            <li><strong>Produce, not just post</strong>: serve together monthly and keep action lists.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Why Brotherhood?</h2>
          <p>Men's growth—both healing and hardening—happens in the company they keep. A righteous brotherhood:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Restores standards:</strong> Rekindles responsibility and honour.</li>
            <li><strong>Strengthens identity:</strong> Reinforces what it means to be a present man, father, and leader.</li>
            <li><strong>Disrupts generational drift:</strong> Breaks destructive cycles quietly passed through families.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><em>What we're fighting for:</em> Sons and daughters who see men show up, stay the course, and keep their word—at home, at work, and under pressure.</p>

          <h2>The Code (Covenant of Presence &amp; Integrity)</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Show up.</strong> Weekly touchpoints. <strong>No ghosts.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Tell the truth.</strong> Confess struggles <strong>before</strong> you collapse.</li>
            <li><strong>Carry weight.</strong> Pray, call, turn up at the door.</li>
            <li><strong>Protect families.</strong> No gossip; no shortcuts. <strong>Cover, don't expose.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Build together.</strong> Study, train, serve. <strong>Produce—not just post.</strong></li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>Red flags—deal fast:</strong> chronic lateness without accountability, secret-keeping, triangulation, and spiritual one-upmanship. Name them early; repair or release.</p>

          <h2>Meeting Rhythm (60–90 minutes)</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>45 min:</strong> Scripture + discussion (foundation)</li>
            <li><strong>30 min:</strong> Formation (habits, money, marriage, parenting)</li>
            <li><strong>15 min:</strong> Intercession (names, needs, next steps)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Strong men aren't found; they're <strong>forged—together</strong>.</p>

          <h2>Start a Group in 14 Days (Playbook)</h2>
          <p><strong>Week 1 — Seed</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Identify <strong>3–5 men</strong> you respect. Share this post and ask for a <strong>90-day pilot</strong>.</li>
            <li>Lock one weekly slot (same time, same place). Public café or living room.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Week 2 — Frame</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Read the <strong>Code</strong> aloud; everyone signs a one-page covenant.</li>
            <li>Choose a <strong>Scripture track</strong> (e.g., Sermon on the Mount).</li>
            <li>Choose a <strong>Formation track</strong> (habits &amp; money).</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Week 3 — Forge</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Run the rhythm three consecutive weeks. Track wins, needs, and follow-ups.</li>
            <li>Elect a <strong>timekeeper</strong> and <strong>scribe</strong>; rotate monthly.</li>
          </ul>

          <blockquote>
            <p><em>One-page covenant (template):</em> We commit for 90 days to weekly presence, truth-telling, confidentiality, practical service, and family protection. We will correct in love, receive correction with humility, and escalate conflict quickly for peace. <strong>Signed:</strong> ____ ____ ____ ____ <strong>Date:</strong> _____</p>
          </blockquote>

          <h2>Roles That Keep It Moving</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Convener:</strong> Books space, sends reminders.</li>
            <li><strong>Timekeeper:</strong> Guards the clock so content lands, not drifts.</li>
            <li><strong>Scribe:</strong> Captures 1–3 action items per man; checks progress next week.</li>
            <li><strong>Chaplain:</strong> Opens/closes in prayer; coordinates care if crisis hits.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Accountability That Builds, Not Breaks</h2>
          <p><strong>The Stack</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Facts first:</strong> What happened? When? What did you do—or not do?</li>
            <li><strong>Heart next:</strong> What were you feeling? What did you believe in the moment?</li>
            <li><strong>Hope last:</strong> What's the next right step? Who's your accountability partner?</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Accountability is not surveillance. It's <strong>shared courage</strong>.</p>

          <h2>A 60-Minute Starter Agenda (Week 1)</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Opening (5 min):</strong> Welcome, purpose, prayer.</li>
            <li><strong>Scripture (15 min):</strong> Read Matthew 5:1–12 (Beatitudes). Each man shares one striking line.</li>
            <li><strong>Formation (20 min):</strong> Habit audit—sleep, Scripture, sweat, sunlight, support. Pick <strong>one</strong> micro-habit.</li>
            <li><strong>Commitments (10 min):</strong> Each states one concrete step + deadline.</li>
            <li><strong>Intercession (10 min):</strong> Pray names and needs. Text encouragement before leaving.</li>
          </ul>

          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>"Two are better than one... If either falls, one helps the other up."</strong> — <em>Ecclesiastes 4:9–10</em></p>
          </blockquote>

          <h2>Guardrails that Make Brotherhood Last</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Stories stay in the room.</li>
            <li><strong>No fixing during grief:</strong> Listen first; solutions later.</li>
            <li><strong>Short answers, long obedience:</strong> Keep shares concise; commitments strong.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve monthly:</strong> Help a family, clean a community space, or mentor a young dad.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>If conflict arises:</strong> address within 48 hours directly; bring one other brother if unresolved; pause leadership roles until peace is made.</p>

          <h2>Outcomes We're After</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Fathers present at home and in community.</li>
            <li>Marriages strengthened by truth and tenderness.</li>
            <li>Young men apprenticed in skill and character.</li>
            <li>A respected name in your city.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The cycle breaks when men keep small promises over time.</p>

# FATHERING WITHOUT FEAR: A Memoir That Defies Every Boundary

"If You give me my life back, I'll serve You until I'm seventy-five."
This was the desperate prayer of an eight-year-old boy who died and miraculously came back.
But some promises demand a price far greater than one can imagine.
They called them the miracle triplets, born at just 27 weeks in 1977 Lagos—too early, too poor, too impossible.
Three became two, and two became legends. Yet, legends are forged in fire.
From Lagos to Akure to London, Abraham faced three cities, three devastating fires, and three chances to disappear.
He survived them all, but not everyone did.

"Something always happens," his brother David would say, a mantra of false hope until 2003, when the words became prophecy.
The brother who was never just a cousin became a ghost, leaving Abraham with a faith-shattering question: "Where was God when David died?"
This profound loss broke his faith, only to forge an unyielding purpose.
It propelled him into a London courtroom, battling for a son who carries the name of kings, against a system designed to make fathers disappear.
What they don't tell you about miracles is that they attract darkness like light attracts moths.
They make you a target for unseen forces. They cost you people you can't afford to lose.
But Abraham's journey is one of relentless resurrection: every time they tried to bury him, he rose.
Every time they tried to silence him, he spoke. Every time they tried to separate him from his son, he clung to the promise.
**"This isn't just survival. It's resurrection."**

*Fathering Without Fear* is the story they thought they knew, of the man they tried to erase, and the father who fathered without fear, even when fear was all he had left.
It's the memoir that becomes a love story, the love story that becomes a legend, and the legend that becomes a movement.

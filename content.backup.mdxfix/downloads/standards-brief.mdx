      ## The 5 Standards That Endure

      This is a 1-page summary for rapid self-governance.

      ### Daily Non-Negotiables (24/7)

      * **Altar:** 10 minutes of Scripture & Prayer.
      * **Order:** Zero inbox, clear desk, made bed.
      * **Tone:** Speak no contempt. No sarcasm, no excuses.
      * **Focus:** Complete the most difficult task by 11 AM.

      ### Weekly Rhythm (Review)

      * **Sabbath:** 24 hours without hustling or buying.
      * **Council:** Review week with spouse/partner.
      * **Service:** Serve someone who cannot repay you.

      ### Quarterly Audit (Strategy)

      * **Walk the House:** Where is chaos winning?
      * **Walk the Calendar:** Does time reflect mission?
      * **Walk the Statement:** Is spending aligned with standards?
      
      <Rule />

      <p>This standard is for building legacy, not chasing influence.</p>

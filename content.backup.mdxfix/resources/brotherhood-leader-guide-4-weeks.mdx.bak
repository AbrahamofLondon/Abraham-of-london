## What this is

A minimal, repeatable **4-week plan** to start strong.

### Week 1 Standards & Presence

- Read: Ecclesiastes 4:912
- Practice: show up, on time, phones parked
- Deliverable: agree the **one** weekly slot

### Week 2 Truth & Confession

- Frame: _facts feelings forward_
- Practice: 2-minute confession; no fixing
- Deliverable: one micro-habit for 7 days

### Week 3 Service & Households

- Practice: pick one burden to lift this week
- Deliverable: a **date & person** to help

### Week 4 Review & Renew

- Score 01: presence, truth, service
- Decide: renew, redefine, or release

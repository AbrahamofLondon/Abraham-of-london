      # Events Blueprint: Strategy & Execution

      <Rule />

      ## 1. The Principle: High Trust, Low Noise

      Our events are not for scale; they are for depth. We aim for high-impact relationships, not high-volume attendees. The goal is to generate **clarity**, not consensus.

      <PullLine>
        We don't sell access. We sell **transformation**.
      </PullLine>

      <Note tone="key" title="Non-Negotiables">
        * **Chatham House Rules:** Protection of private thought is paramount.
        * **Invite Only:** Pre-vetted attendees ensure trust and quality of conversation.
        * **Zero Pitching:** The focus is learning and giving, not selling.
      </Note>

      <Rule />

      ## 2. The Blueprint: Format & Cadence

      ### A. The Salon (Small-Group Working Session)
      * **Goal:** Structural decision-making and standard setting.
      * **Size:** 12–16 Principals.
      * **Duration:** 3–4 hours (morning only).
      * **Deliverable:** Attendees leave with a tangible **Blueprint** or **Standards Document**.
      * **Cadence:** Quarterly (1x per quarter).

      ### B. The Forum (Fellowship & Deep Dive)
      * **Goal:** Community, accountability, and spiritual anchoring.
      * **Size:** 25–40 Men.
      * **Duration:** Full day or evening event.
      * **Deliverable:** Shared experience, brotherhood connection, and high-trust peer accountability.
      * **Cadence:** Bi-Annual (2x per year).

      <Rule />

      ## 3. The Execution: Pre-Work & Follow-up

      ### Pre-Work (The Vetting)
      * **Preread:** Every attendee receives a 1–2 page PDF brief (e.g., `standards-brief.pdf`). This sets the tone and vets their commitment.
      * **Pre-call:** A brief, 5-minute call with 1/3 of attendees to confirm intent and gauge readiness.
      * **Assets:** Send all necessary pre-read materials (location, agenda, Chatham rules) 7 days in advance.

      ### Logistics (The Atmosphere)
      * **Tone:** Elegant, minimalist, serious. No unnecessary glitz.
      * **Timing:** Start on time, end on time. Respect for others' calendars is a standard.
      * **Food:** High quality, simple, and not distracting.

      ### Post-Work (The Legacy)
      * **Immediate:** Thank you note sent within 24 hours.
      * **Tool:** Send the agreed-upon **Workshop Notes/PDF** immediately to convert conversation into action.
      * **Accountability:** Assign a follow-up action step (e.g., "call your accountability partner").

      <Rule />

      <Note tone="warning" title="Risk Management">
        * **No Shows:** Overbook by 15% for paid events, but maintain a waitlist for invite-only to respect the room size.
        * **Low Trust:** If a participant violates Chatham House rules, they are not invited back. Protect the room.
        * **Mission Drift:** Always tie the event back to the core principles: **Sovereignty, Strategy, Faith.**
      </Note>

      <PullLine subtle>
        The event is the ritual. The transformation is the work.
      </PullLine>

# Authoring Rules (MDX)

These guardrails stop regressions and keep the reading surface premium. Follow themâ€”no exceptions.

## 1) Titles & Headings
- **Do not write an H1 in MDX.** The page template owns `<h1>`.
- Start your document at `##` (H2). Nest logically (`###`, `####`) as needed.
- Keep headings short, descriptive, and keyword-aware.

```md
## Section Heading (H2)
Clear, skimmable intro sentence.

This post dives deep into the nuances that distinguish **bespoke tailoring** from **made-to-measure**.

#### Key Differences:
* **Pattern Creation:** Bespoke involves a new pattern created from scratch for each client. Made-to-measure adapts an existing block pattern.
* **Fittings:** Bespoke typically includes multiple fittings during the garment's construction, allowing for adjustments. Made-to-measure usually has fewer.
* **Customization:** Bespoke offers virtually limitless customization. Made-to-measure has set options.

Ultimately, both provide a superior fit to off-the-rack, but bespoke is the pinnacle of personalized craftsmanship.

# Christianity Is Not Extremism - It Is the Light That Built the World

Why does the public square so quickly label Christianity **"extremist"**—flattening distinctions as if all faiths were interchangeable? Words matter. So do **origins**, **means**, and **fruits**.

This is not an attack on neighbours of any creed. Christians are commanded to love every neighbour (_Luke 10:27_) and honour all people (_1 Peter 2:17_). This is a fatherly confession: **Christianity is not extremism**. It is the good news that **Jesus Christ is Lord**, and that in Him there is forgiveness, life, and a new way to be human.

<Rule />

## 1) Origins Matter: The Founder Is the Message

Christianity stands or falls with **Jesus Christ**—promised, incarnate, crucified, risen, reigning.

<PullLine>The Founder **is** the message (*John 14:6*). The Gospel advances by witness and costly love, **not coercion**.</PullLine>

- Our centre is **person**, not party.
- Our proof is **resurrection**, not rage.
- Our method is **preaching, service, and sacrificial love**, not compulsion.

<Rule />

## 2) Fruits Matter: The Legacy of the Light

<Verse cite="Matthew 7:16">By their fruits you will know them.</Verse>

Where the Gospel roots, hospitals, universities, literacy, care for the poor, and the _imago Dei_ basis for human dignity flourish. Christians fail; **repentance** is our corrective. The standard is not us—but **Him**.

- **Human dignity** from the image of God
- **Mercy institutions** (hospitals, relief, orphan care)
- **Learning & language** (schools, translation, universities)
- **Reform movements** sparked by conscience (slavery abolition, prison reform)

<Caption>Failures are real; **repentance** is how the Church returns to her Lord.</Caption>

<Rule />

## 3) What "Radical" Really Means

If "radical" means **rooted** (from _radix_, meaning root), then yes—Christianity is radical. The early church "turned the world upside down" (_Acts 17:6_) through proclamation, **service**, and **sacrifice**. Our revolution is **cross-shaped**—the power to lay down our lives for our enemies, not take theirs.

<Rule />

## 4) On Islam—And Neighbours We Love

Discussion often flattens distinctions. From a Christian confession:

- **Jesus is God the Son**; Islam denies this.
- The Gospel spreads by **preaching and repentance**—faith is never compelled.
- **Scripture** forms Christian ethics and corrects our failures.

<Note tone="key" title="Contend without contempt">
  We contend with **ideas**, not with **people** (*2 Cor. 10:5*). Our posture is invitation: *Come to Christ and live.* Love your neighbour. Tell the truth. Keep your heart clean.
</Note>

<Rule />

## 5) Fathers, Stand Firm: No Tepid Compromise

I'm raising **O-J-A-Y** to carry light without apology. If culture calls obedience "extreme," so be it. Tepid compromise is worse.

<PullLine subtle>• **Scripture before screens** · **Prayer before plans** · **Holiness before hype** · **Craft before clout** · **Courage with kindness**</PullLine>

**House rule (weekly):**

- Read the **Sermon on the Mount** aloud as a family (Matt 5-7).
- One act of mercy together (visit, call, give, serve).
- One hospitality moment (invite in a neighbour who believes differently).
- Review speech: **No contempt**; truth + tenderness only.

<Rule />

## 6) The Call: Exclusive Truth, Inclusive Grace

The Gospel is exclusive because truth is exclusive (_Acts 4:12_)—yet gloriously inclusive:

<Verse cite="Romans 10:13">Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.</Verse>

<PullLine>**Repent and live** (*Acts 3:19-20*). Christ is the Light of the world (*John 8:12*). As for our house, **we will serve the Lord** (*Joshua 24:15*).</PullLine>

<Rule />

## Practice: A Father's 7-Day Witness

- **Day 1 - Word:** Read John 1. Note one line to live.
- **Day 2 - Prayer:** 10 minutes for your child's courage and compassion.
- **Day 3 - Craft:** Make something excellent (meal, essay, deck) "as unto the Lord."
- **Day 4 - Mercy:** Give privately; don't post it.
- **Day 5 - Hospitality:** Share a table with someone who disagrees with you. Listen well.
- **Day 6 - Courage:** Speak one gracious truth you've avoided.
- **Day 7 - Rest:** Worship. Put your phone away for three hours. Delight in God.

<Rule />

## For Groups (4 Questions)

1. Where is your view of Christianity shaped more by headlines than by Jesus?
2. Which "fruit" of the Gospel have you seen firsthand? What would multiply it in your city?
3. How do you practice "contend without contempt" online and at the table?
4. What one house rule will your children feel this week?

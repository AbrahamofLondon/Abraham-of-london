# Christianity Is Not Extremism: A Study in Systems

<Rule />

<Verse cite="John 14:6">I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.</Verse>

# Dear JPost: Stop lumping Christianity in with Islam under the banner of “extremism”

*By Abraham of London, 17 August 2025*

Preaching isn’t extremism. Conflating Christianity with Islam because both have zealots is lazy thinking.

## 1) The Source Code

* **The Christian Root:** The methodology was the **Cross**. Violence is a mutation.
* **The Islamic Root:** The methodology was the **Conquest**. Expansion is a fulfillment.

## 2) The Category Error

If extremism is defined as coercion, then Christians being faithful to the Gospel are not extremists.

# Christianity Is Not Extremism: A Study in Systems

Why does the public square so quickly label Christianity "extremist"? It is an act of intellectual shorthand—a category error that confuses **strong conviction** with **coercive power**.

# Dear JPost: Stop lumping Christianity in with Islam under the banner of “extremism”

*By Abraham of London, 17 August 2025*

I read Donald Zev Uslan’s Jerusalem Post piece, “Dear triumphalist Christians, Muslims: Please leave us Jews alone.” I get the exhaustion. I get the fear. I also get the confusion that comes from collapsing very different things into one scary bucket labelled **extremism**. 

Here’s my simple point: **preaching isn’t extremism**. Conflating Christianity with Islam because both have zealots is lazy thinking. If you want to critique coercion, violence, or harassment, I’ll stand next to you. But if you’re going to call the ordinary, historic Christian practice of evangelism “extreme,” then you’re misdefining the term and misreading the sources.

## 1) The Source Code: A Study in Systems

Every global movement has a "root logic" governed by its Founder’s template. To understand why these two systems are not twins, we must look at the biological DNA of their origins.



* **The Christian Root:** Jesus Christ’s "success" was His death. His methodology was the **Cross**—the ultimate expression of power through suffering. He established a kingdom that requires no territory, no tax, and no standing army. Therefore, any Christian use of force is a mutation, not a maturation, of the faith.
* **The Islamic Root:** Muhammad’s success was his victory. His methodology was the **Conquest**—the fusion of prophecy with the polity. He established a Ummah (community) that requires territory, a legal code (Sharia), and a defense mechanism. Therefore, the use of force for the expansion of the system is a fulfillment, not a deviation, of the root logic.

## 2) Strategic Divergence: Persuasion vs. Submission

At their origins, Christianity and Islam don’t merely differ in degree; they differ in **kind**.

* **Christianity (Persuasion):** The New Testament provides no blueprint for governing by force. Its weapons are proclamation and sacrificial love. 
* **Islam (Submission):** Islam, by its very name, means **Submission**. It is a religious-political imperial project. Its "Peace" (Salaam) is a state of order achieved when the world submits to the law of Allah.

## 3) Methods Flow from Founders

**Christianity’s native method** is preaching and service. When "Christendom" later compromised this, those coercive turns were corrected from within by going **back to the Founder and the text**.

**Islam’s native method** includes da'wah (invitation) but also, integrally, **state power**. The early expansion was achieved by imperial conquest.

## 4) Fruits: The Worlds They Build

Where Christianity has shaped cultures at its best, we see the emergence of **the equal worth of persons** and **freedom of conscience**. 

Where Islam has shaped cultures, the persistent fusion of religion and state has typically made **full religious freedom** a bridge too far. 
***
## 5) Is Christianity “Radical”?

Yes. It is abrasive to pride because it says: there is truth; you need saving; and salvation is found **in Christ alone**. 

But **abrasive** is not **abusive**. **Radical message != Radical methods.** The message is relentless; the methods are constrained: preach, persuade, suffer if you must, but **do not coerce**. 
***
## 6) The Category Error

If extremism is defined as coercion or domination, then Christians being faithful to the Gospel are not extremists. Lumping the Christian confession of "Christ Alone" in with the Islamic demand for "Global Submission" is "Theological Dyslexia"—failing to distinguish between **Abrasive Truth** and **Coercive Power**.
***
## 7) The Real Ask

Let’s be honest with our sources. Define extremism narrowly (coercion, violence, domination). Protect everyone’s freedom to preach, persuade, and reject each other’s claims.

### Appendix: Systemic Anchors

**Christian DNA**: Matthew 5; Matthew 28:18–20; John 18:36; Acts 17:6; 1 Peter 3:15.
**Islamic DNA**: Classical jurisprudence on jihad and dhimmitude; the Medinan legislative framework; the Imperial Caliphate.

Preaching is not extremism. Coercion is. And those two are not the same—either in logic or in history.

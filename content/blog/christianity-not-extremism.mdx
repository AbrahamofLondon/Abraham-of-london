# Christianity Is Not Extremism — It Is the Light That Built the World

Why does the public square so quickly label Christianity **“extremist”**—flattening distinctions as if all faiths were interchangeable? Words matter. So do **origins**, **means**, and **fruits**.

This is not an attack on neighbours of any creed. Christians are commanded to love every neighbour (*Luke 10:27*) and honour all people (*1 Peter 2:17*). This is a fatherly confession: **Christianity is not extremism**. It is the good news that **Jesus Christ is Lord**, and that in Him there is forgiveness, life, and a new way to be human.

<Rule />

## 1) Origins Matter: The Founder Is the Message

Christianity stands or falls with **Jesus Christ**—promised, incarnate, crucified, risen, reigning.

<PullLine>
  The Founder **is** the message (*John 14:6*). The Gospel advances by witness and costly love, **not coercion**.
</PullLine>

## 2) Fruits Matter: The Legacy of the Light

<Verse cite="Matthew 7:16">
  By their fruits you will know them.
</Verse>

Where the Gospel roots, hospitals, universities, literacy, care for the poor, and the *imago-Dei* basis for human dignity flourish. Christians fail; **repentance** is our corrective. The standard is not us—but **Him**.

## 3) What “Radical” Really Means

If “radical” means **rooted** (from *radix*, meaning root), then yes—Christianity is radical.

The early church turned the world upside down (*Acts 17:6*) through proclamation, service, and sacrifice. Our revolution is **cross-shaped**.

## 4) About Islam—And Neighbours We Love

Debate often flattens critical differences. From a Christian confession:

-   **Jesus is God the Son**; Islam denies this.
-   The Gospel spreads by **preaching and repentance**—faith is never compelled.
-   **Scripture** forms Christian ethics and corrects our failures.

<Note tone="key">
  We contend with **ideas**, not with **people** (*2 Cor. 10:5*). Our posture is invitation: *Come to Christ and live.*
</Note>

## 5) Fathers, Stand Firm: No Tepid Compromise

I’m raising **O-J-A-Y** to carry light without apology. If culture calls obedience “extreme,” so be it. Tepid compromise is worse.

<PullLine subtle>
  - **Scripture before screens**
  - **Prayer before plans**
  - **Holiness before hype**
  - **Craft before clout**
  - **Courage with kindness**
</PullLine>

## 6) The Call: Exclusive Truth, Inclusive Grace

The Gospel is exclusive because truth is exclusive (*Acts 4:12*)—yet gloriously inclusive:

<Verse cite="Romans 10:13">
  Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.
</Verse>

<PullLine>
  **Repent and live** (*Acts 3:19–20*). Christ is the Light of the world (*John 8:12*). As for our house, **we will serve the Lord** (*Josh. 24:15*).

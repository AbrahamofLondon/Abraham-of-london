# Christianity Is Not Extremism — It Is the Light That Built the World

Why does today’s public square so quickly label Christianity **“extremist”**—sometimes lumping it beside Islam as if all faiths were interchangeable? Words matter. So do origins, means, and fruits. If language is used to blur these distinctions, truth is lost and the next generation inherits confusion instead of conviction.

This essay is not an attack on neighbours of any creed. Christians are commanded to love every neighbour (Luke 10:27) and to honour all people (1 Peter 2:17). What follows is a clear, fatherly confession: **Christianity is not extremism**. It is the good news that **Jesus Christ is Lord**, and that in Him there is forgiveness, life, and a new way of being human.

## 1) Origins Matter: The Lord Jesus vs. all rivals

Christianity begins and stands with **Jesus Christ**—promised in the Law and the Prophets, born of a virgin, sinless in life, crucified for sinners, raised bodily on the third day, and enthroned as Lord of all. The Founder is the **message** (John 14:6). Our faith is not a set of techniques but the announcement of a Person and His kingdom.

> “For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins… that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day.”  
> — 1 Corinthians 15:3–4

Because the Founder gave Himself rather than taking from others, **coercion is excluded**. The Gospel advances by persuasion, witness, and costly love—not by the sword.

## 2) Fruits Matter: What the Gospel Builds

Jesus said, **“By their fruits you will know them.”** (Matthew 7:16)

Where the Gospel has taken root, it has birthed hospitals, universities, literacy movements, the defence of the poor, the dignity of women and children, the imago-Dei basis for human rights, and the stubborn belief that rulers are not gods. Christians have often failed; repentance is part of our DNA. But corruption has no warrant in Christ or in Scripture. Reform is possible because the standard is outside us: **the Lord Himself**.

---

## 3) What “Radical” Really Means

If by “radical” we mean **rooted**, then yes—Christianity is radical. It uproots sin at the root and plants a new life. The early church “turned the world upside down” (Acts 17:6) not through domination but through **proclamation, service, and sacrifice**. Our revolution is a cross-shaped one: enemies loved, truth spoken, lives laid down.

## 4) A Word on Islam—And on Neighbours We Love

Public debate often flattens differences between religions. From a Christian confession:

- **Jesus is God the Son**; Islam denies this.  
- The Gospel spreads by **preaching and repentance**; Christians are forbidden to compel faith.  
- **Scripture** forms the Christian’s ethics; where Christians have sinned, Scripture corrects us.

These are **differences in essence and means**. They must be stated clearly without malice toward Muslims, whom we are called to love. Christians contend with **ideas**, not with **people** (2 Corinthians 10:5). Our posture is invitation: *“Come to Christ and live.”*

## 5) Fathers, Stand Firm: Why I Will Raise **O-J-A-Y**

I am a father under orders. My assignment is to raise **O-J-A-Y** not merely to succeed, but to **bear witness**—to **call people to repentance and to life under the lordship of Jesus**. That means:

- **Scripture before screens**: the Word forms his appetite for truth.  
- **Prayer before plans**: dependency before strategy.  
- **Holiness before hype**: private integrity before public platform.  
- **Craft before clout**: disciplined work, not borrowed status.  
- **Courage with kindness**: fearless truth, generous heart.

I will train my son to speak of sin without sneer, to preach grace without dilution, and to carry himself as a man under authority—the authority of **King Jesus**. If the culture calls that “extreme,” so be it. **Better to be extreme in obedience than tepid in compromise.**

---

## 6) The Call: Repent and Live

The Gospel is exclusive because truth is exclusive: **“There is salvation in no one else.”** (Acts 4:12) Yet the invitation is gloriously **inclusive**: *“Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”* (Romans 10:13)

> “Repent, therefore, and turn back, that your sins may be blotted out, that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord.”  
> — Acts 3:19–20

If you are weary of the charge of “extremism,” come and see the **extremity of God’s love**—the Son of God hanging between earth and heaven, bearing our sin, rising for our justification, reigning until He makes all things new.

---

## Final Word

Christianity is not extremism. **Christ is the Light of the world** (John 8:12), and His people are called to shine. As for my house, we will not pass down fog. We will pass down **faith**.

> “As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.”  
> — Joshua 24:15

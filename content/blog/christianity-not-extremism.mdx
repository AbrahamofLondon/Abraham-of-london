# Christianity Is Not Extremism - It Is the Light That Built the World

Why does the public square so quickly label Christianity "extremist"—flattening distinctions as if all faiths were interchangeable? Words matter. So do origins, means, and fruits.

This is not an attack on neighbours of any creed. Christians are commanded to love every neighbour and honour all people. This is a fatherly confession: Christianity is not extremism. It is the good news that Jesus Christ is Lord, and that in Him there is forgiveness, life, and a new way to be human.

<Rule />

## 1) Origins Matter: The Founder Is the Message

Christianity stands or falls with Jesus Christ—promised, incarnate, crucified, risen, reigning.

<PullLine>
  The Founder is the message (John 14:6). The Gospel advances by witness and costly love, not coercion.
</PullLine>

- Our centre is person, not party.
- Our proof is resurrection, not rage.
- Our method is preaching, service, and sacrificial love, not compulsion.

<Rule />

## 2) Fruits Matter: The [Legacy](/lexicon/legacy) of the Light

<Verse cite="Matthew 7:16">By their fruits you will know them.</Verse>

Where the Gospel roots, hospitals, universities, literacy, care for the poor, and the imago Dei basis for human dignity flourish. Christians fail; repentance is our corrective. The standard is not us, but Him.

- Human dignity from the image of God
- Mercy institutions (hospitals, relief, orphan care)
- Learning and language (schools, translation, universities)
- Reform movements sparked by conscience (slavery abolition, prison reform)

<Caption>
  Failures are real; repentance is how the Church returns to her Lord.
</Caption>

<Rule />

## 3) What "Radical" Really Means

If radical means rooted (from radix, root), then yes—Christianity is radical.

The early church "turned the world upside down" through proclamation, service, and sacrifice. Our revolution is cross-shaped: the power to lay down our lives for our enemies, not take theirs.

<Rule />

## 4) Contend Without Contempt

<Note tone="key" title="Contend without contempt">
  We contend with ideas, not with people. Love your neighbour. Tell the truth. Keep your heart clean.
</Note>

<Rule />

## 5) Fathers, Stand Firm: No Tepid Compromise

I am raising O-J-A-Y to carry light without apology. If culture calls obedience "extreme," so be it. Tepid compromise is worse.

<PullLine subtle>
  • Scripture before screens · Prayer before plans · Holiness before hype · Craft before clout · Courage with kindness
</PullLine>

<Rule />

## 6) The Call: Exclusive Truth, Inclusive Grace

The Gospel is exclusive because truth is exclusive—yet gloriously inclusive:

<Verse cite="Romans 10:13">
  Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.
</Verse>

<PullLine>
  Repent and live. Christ is the Light of the world. As for our house, we will serve the Lord.
</PullLine>

Why does the public square so quickly label Christianity **“extremist”**—flattening distinctions as if all faiths were interchangeable? Words matter. So do **origins**, **means**, and **fruits**.

This is not an attack on neighbours of any creed. Christians are commanded to love every neighbour (Luke 10:27) and honour all people (1 Peter 2:17). This is a fatherly confession: **Christianity is not extremism**. It is the good news that **Jesus Christ is Lord**, and that in Him there is forgiveness, life, and a new way to be human.

## 1) Origins Matter

Christianity stands or falls with **Jesus Christ**—promised, incarnate, crucified, risen, reigning.  
The Founder **is** the message (John 14:6). The Gospel advances by witness and costly love, not coercion.

## 2) Fruits Matter

“By their fruits you will know them” (Matt. 7:16). Where the Gospel roots, hospitals, universities, literacy, care for the poor, and the imago-Dei basis for human dignity flourish. Christians fail; **repentance** is our corrective. The standard is not us—but **Him**.

## 3) What “Radical” Really Means

If “radical” means **rooted**, then yes—Christianity is radical. The early church turned the world upside down (Acts 17:6) through proclamation, service, and sacrifice. Our revolution is **cross-shaped**.

## 4) About Islam—And Neighbours We Love

Debate often flattens differences. From a Christian confession:

- **Jesus is God the Son**; Islam denies this.  
- The Gospel spreads by **preaching and repentance**—faith is never compelled.  
- **Scripture** forms Christian ethics and corrects our failures.

We contend with **ideas**, not with **people** (2 Cor. 10:5). Our posture is invitation: *Come to Christ and live.*

## 5) Fathers, Stand Firm

I’m raising **O-J-A-Y** to carry light without apology:

- **Scripture before screens**  
- **Prayer before plans**  
- **Holiness before hype**  
- **Craft before clout**  
- **Courage with kindness**

If culture calls obedience “extreme,” so be it. Tepid compromise is worse.

## 6) The Call

The Gospel is exclusive because truth is exclusive (Acts 4:12)—yet gloriously inclusive: “Everyone who calls…” (Rom. 10:13).  
**Repent and live** (Acts 3:19–20). Christ is the Light of the world (John 8:12). As for our house, we will serve the Lord (Josh. 24:15).

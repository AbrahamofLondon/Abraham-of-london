# Christianity Is Not Extremism: A Study in Systems

Why does the public square so quickly label Christianity "extremist"? It is an act of intellectual shorthand—a category error that confuses **strong conviction** with **coercive power**.

# Dear JPost: Stop lumping Christianity in with Islam under the banner of “extremism”

*By Abraham of London, 17 August 2025*

I read Donald Zev Uslan’s Jerusalem Post piece, “Dear triumphalist Christians, Muslims: Please leave us Jews alone.” I get the exhaustion. I get the fear. I also get the confusion that comes from collapsing very different things into one scary bucket labelled **extremism**. 

Here’s my simple point: **preaching isn’t extremism**. Conflating Christianity with Islam because both have zealots is lazy thinking. If you want to critique coercion, violence, or harassment, I’ll stand next to you. But if you’re going to call the ordinary, historic Christian practice of evangelism “extreme,” then you’re misdefining the term and misreading the sources.

## 1) The Source Code: A Study in Systems

Every global movement has a "root logic" governed by its Founder’s template. To understand why these two systems are not twins, we must look at the biological DNA of their origins.



* **The Christian Root:** Jesus Christ’s "success" was His death. His methodology was the **Cross**—the ultimate expression of power through suffering. He established a kingdom that requires no territory, no tax, and no standing army. Therefore, any Christian use of force is a *mutation*, not a maturation, of the faith.
* **The Islamic Root:** Muhammad’s success was his victory. His methodology was the **Conquest**—the fusion of prophecy with the polity. He established a *Ummah* (community) that requires territory, a legal code (*Sharia*), and a defense mechanism. Therefore, the use of force for the expansion of the system is a *fulfillment*, not a deviation, of the root logic.

## 2) Strategic Divergence: Persuasion vs. Submission

At their origins, Christianity and Islam don’t merely differ in *degree*; they differ in **kind**.

* **Christianity (Persuasion):** The New Testament provides no blueprint for governing by force. Its weapons are proclamation and sacrificial love. Christian "Peace" (*Eirene*) is a reconciliation of the soul that can persist even under the boot of a tyrant. It seeks to convert the heart through an invitation that can be refused.
* **Islam (Submission):** Islam, by its very name, means **Submission**. It is a religious-political imperial project. Its "Peace" (*Salaam*) is a state of order achieved when the world submits to the law of Allah. It seeks to govern the body through the external work of the State.

## 3) Methods Flow from Founders

**Christianity’s native method** is preaching and service. From the first centuries, Christians grew by caring for the sick and rescuing abandoned infants while being martyred for their words. Yes, "Christendom" later compromised this (Crusades, Inquisitions). But crucially, those coercive turns were corrected *from within* by going **back to the Founder and the text**.

**Islam’s native method** includes *da‘wah* (invitation) but also, integrally, **state power**. The early expansion across the Levant and North Africa wasn’t achieved by debate clubs; it was imperial conquest.

## 4) Fruits: The Worlds They Build

Jesus gives a test: “By their fruits you will know them” (Matthew 7:16). 

Where Christianity has shaped cultures at its best, we see the emergence of **the equal worth of persons**, **freedom of conscience**, and the **moral duty to persuade rather than compel**. 

Where Islam has shaped cultures, the persistent fusion of religion and state has typically made **full religious freedom** (the right to convert *away* from Islam) a bridge too far.

## 5) Is Christianity “Radical”?

Yes. Christianity is a **radical departure** from the world’s default. It is abrasive to pride because it says: there is truth; you need saving; and salvation is found **in Christ alone**. 

But **abrasive** is not **abusive**. 
**Radical message ≠ Radical methods.** The message is relentless; the methods are constrained: preach, persuade, suffer if you must, but **do not coerce**. 

---

## 6) The Category Error

If *extremism* is defined as coercion or domination, then Christians being faithful to the Gospel are not extremists. The correct Christian response to Jewish fear is not to mute the gospel; it is to **preach with gentleness and respect** (1 Peter 3:15) and to defend **your** freedom to disagree with us publicly and forever.

Lumping the Christian confession of "Christ Alone" in with the Islamic demand for "Global Submission" is an intellectual shortcut that serves nobody. It is "Theological Dyslexia"—failing to distinguish between **Abrasive Truth** and **Coercive Power**.

---

## 7) The Real Ask

Let’s be honest with our sources. Define extremism narrowly (coercion, violence, domination). Protect everyone’s freedom to preach, persuade, and reject each other’s claims. 

Judge each tradition by its founder and its fruits, not just by the loudest headlines.

### Appendix: Systemic Anchors

**Christian DNA**: Matthew 5; Matthew 28:18–20; John 18:36; Acts 17:6; 1 Peter 3:15.
**Islamic DNA**: Classical jurisprudence on *jihad* and *dhimmitude*; the Medinan legislative framework; the Imperial Caliphate.

Preaching is not extremism. Coercion is. And those two are not the same—either in logic or in history.

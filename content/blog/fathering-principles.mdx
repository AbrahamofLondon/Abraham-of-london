# Fathering Principles: A Blueprint for Men

<Verse cite="Proverbs 22:6">
  Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it.
</Verse>

O.J.A-Y won’t inherit fear. He’ll inherit **clarity, conviction, and a legacy rooted in purpose**.

Here’s what I’m teaching him—and living in front of him:

<PullLine subtle>
  - **Think critically.** Ask better questions. Seek wisdom over noise.
  - **Lead with humility.** Strength without pride. Service before spotlight. Repent quickly; forgive fully.
  - **Fight spiritually.** Our battles are not flesh and blood. Pray, fast, guard your mind, wield the Word.
  - **Honor truth—even when it costs.** Integrity is expensive; pay it gladly.
</PullLine>

## Principles Over Preferences

Trends fade. **Principles build families.**

1. **Identity before activity.** Who you are in God anchors what you do in life.
2. **Standards before feelings.** Feelings follow formation. Build disciplines that carry you when emotions won’t.
3. **Order before speed.** Pace kills when there’s no structure. Put first things first—**faith, family, work**.
4. **Stewardship before status.** Money and titles don’t raise sons. **Time, presence, and wisdom** do.
5. **Courage before comfort.** Say the hard thing. Do the right thing. Walk the narrow road.

## Legacy on Purpose

My father taught provision; I’m adding **formation**—mind, spirit, character.
I want a son who can build nations because he first learned to govern himself.

<PullLine>
  **Manhood isn’t defined by culture. It’s defined by the Word.** That’s the inheritance.
</PullLine>

# Fathering Principles: A Blueprint for Men

<Verse cite="Proverbs 22:6">
  Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not
  depart from it.
</Verse>

O.J.A-Y won't inherit fear. He'll inherit **clarity, conviction, and a legacy rooted in purpose**.

Here's what I'm teaching him--and living in front of him.

<PullLine>I'm raising a man, not a moment.</PullLine>

<Rule />

## TL;DR - What I'm Forming

- **Think critically.** Ask better questions; prefer wisdom over noise.
- **Lead with humility.** Strength without pride. Repent quickly; forgive fully.
- **Fight spiritually.** We battle powers, not people--pray, fast, guard your mind, wield the Word.
- **Honour truth even when it costs.** **[Integrity](/lexicon/integrity)** is expensive--pay it gladly.

<Callout tone="key" title="One move today">
  Pick one principle, say it aloud at the table tonight, and choose a
  micro-action to prove it.
</Callout>

<Rule />

## Principles Over Preferences

Trends fade. **Principles build families.**

1. **[Identity](/lexicon/identity)** before activity. Who you are in God anchors what you do in life.
2. **Standards before feelings.** Feelings follow formation. Build disciplines that carry you when emotion won't.
3. **Order before speed.** Pace kills without structure. Put first things first--**faith, family, work**.
4. **Stewardship before status.** Money and titles don't raise sons. **Time, presence, and wisdom** do.
5. **Courage before comfort.** Say the hard thing. Do the right thing. Walk the narrow road.

<Note tone="info" title="Daily micro-rule (8 minutes)">
  60s room reset • 10 push-ups $\times$ 3 • read one proverb aloud • send one encouragement text to your child or spouse.
</Note>

<Rule />

## [Legacy](/lexicon/legacy) on [Purpose](/lexicon/purpose)

My father taught **provision**; I'm adding **formation**--mind, spirit, character.

I want a son who can build nations because he first learned to **govern himself**.


  Manhood isn't defined by culture. It's defined by the Word. That's the
  inheritance.


<Verse cite="Micah 6:8">
  He has shown you, O man, what is good: to act justly, love mercy, and walk
  humbly with your God.
</Verse>

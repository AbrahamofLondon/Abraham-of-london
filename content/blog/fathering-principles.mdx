"Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it." — Proverbs 22:6
*O.J.A-Y won't inherit fear. He'll inherit clarity, conviction, and a legacy rooted in purpose.*

Here’s what I’m teaching him:

- Think critically.
- Lead with humility.
- Fight spiritually.
- Honor truth—no matter how unpopular.

The world doesn’t define manhood. The Word does.

And I will not fail in passing it on.

## The Foundation of Fearless Fatherhood

Fear is a thief. It steals peace, paralyzes purpose, and dims potential. Many men today father from a place of fear—fear of failure, judgment, or losing control. Yet, true fatherhood, as ordained by God, is a position of fearless leadership. It’s about cultivating character, instilling conviction, and building a legacy that transcends generations.

## Principles Over Preferences

In a rapidly changing world, trends fade, but principles endure. I am committed to teaching O.J.A-Y (and any future sons) timeless truths to navigate chaos with clarity.

1. **Think Critically**: The ability to discern truth from deception is essential. I’m guiding him to question narratives, analyze information, and form well-reasoned conclusions—beyond popular opinion. This involves engaging with complex ideas, challenging assumptions (including mine), and seeking wisdom beyond fleeting headlines.
2. **Lead with Humility**: True strength shines through servant leadership, not arrogance. Humility recognizes God’s sovereignty and our dependence on Him, fostering a willingness to learn, admit mistakes, and serve others sacrificially. A humble leader earns respect, not demands it.
3. **Fight Spiritually**: Our battles are not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers (Ephesians 6:12). I’m teaching him that the most critical fights occur through prayer and with the Word of God as his sword. Spiritual warfare is practical, shaping daily life.
4. **Honor Truth—No Matter How Unpopular**: In a world that often rejects truth-tellers, I want him to embody unwavering integrity. Truth is absolute, rooted in God’s character. Standing for it, even at a cost, is the ultimate act of courage and faithfulness.

## Legacy Rooted in Purpose

My father taught me hard work and provision, and I honor that legacy. Yet, for O.J.A-Y, I aim deeper—passing on a blueprint for life that equips him to discover and live his God-given purpose fearlessly.

He won’t inherit timidity, but power, love, and a sound mind (2 Timothy 1:7). His identity will rest in Christ, not the world’s shifting standards. He’ll understand his roles as a man, a leader, and potentially a father.

This isn’t just theory—it’s lived daily through our conversations, my actions, and my commitment to model integrity and purpose.

The world doesn’t define manhood. The Word does.

And I will not fail in passing it on.

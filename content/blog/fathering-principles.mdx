# Fathering Principles: A Blueprint for Men

<Verse cite="Proverbs 22:6">
  Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it.
</Verse>

O.J.A-Y wonâ€™t inherit fear. Heâ€™ll inherit **clarity, conviction, and a legacy rooted in purpose**.

Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™m teaching him â€” and living in front of him:

<PullLine subtle>
  - **Think critically.** Ask better questions. Seek wisdom over noise.  
  - **Lead with humility.** Strength without pride. Service before spotlight. Repent quickly; forgive fully.  
  - **Fight spiritually.** Our battles are not flesh and blood. Pray, fast, guard your mind, wield the Word.  
  - **Honour truth â€” even when it costs.** Integrity is expensive; pay it gladly.
</PullLine>

<Rule />

## Principles Over Preferences

Trends fade. **Principles build families.**

1. **Identity before activity.** Who you are in God anchors what you do in life.  
2. **Standards before feelings.** Feelings follow formation. Build disciplines that carry you when emotions wonâ€™t.  
3. **Order before speed.** Pace kills when thereâ€™s no structure. Put first things first â€” **faith, family, work**.  
4. **Stewardship before status.** Money and titles donâ€™t raise sons. **Time, presence, and wisdom** do.  
5. **Courage before comfort.** Say the hard thing. Do the right thing. Walk the narrow road.

<Rule />

## Legacy on Purpose

My father taught provision; Iâ€™m adding **formation** â€” mind, spirit, character.  
I want a son who can build nations because he first learned to govern himself.

<PullLine>
  **Manhood isnâ€™t defined by culture. Itâ€™s defined by the Word.** Thatâ€™s the inheritance.
</PullLine>

<Rule />

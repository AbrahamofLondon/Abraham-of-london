# Fathering Principles: A Blueprint for Men

<Verse cite="Proverbs 22:6">
  Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it.
</Verse>

O.J.A-Y won't inherit fear. He'll inherit **clarity, conviction, and a legacy rooted in purpose**. Here's what I'm teaching him—and living in front of him.

<PullLine>
  I'm raising a man, not a moment.
</PullLine>

<Rule />

## TL;DR — What I'm Forming

- **Think critically.** Ask better questions; prefer wisdom over noise.
- **Lead with humility.** Strength without pride. Repent quickly; forgive fully.
- **Fight spiritually.** We battle powers, not people—pray, fast, guard your mind, wield the Word.
- **Honour truth even when it costs.** Integrity is expensive—pay it gladly.

  Pick one principle, say it aloud at the table tonight, and choose a micro-action to prove it.

<Rule />

## Principles Over Preferences

Trends fade. **Principles build families.**

1. **Identity before activity.** Who you are in God anchors what you do in life.
2. **Standards before feelings.** Feelings follow formation. Build disciplines that carry you when emotion won't.
3. **Order before speed.** Pace kills without structure. Put first things first—**faith, family, work**.
4. **Stewardship before status.** Money and titles don't raise sons. **Time, presence, and wisdom** do.
5. **Courage before comfort.** Say the hard thing. Do the right thing. Walk the narrow road.

## Legacy on Purpose

My father taught **provision**; I'm adding **formation**—mind, spirit, character. I want a son who can build nations because he first learned to **govern himself**.

<PullLine>
  Manhood isn't defined by culture. It's defined by the Word. That's the inheritance.
</PullLine>

<Verse cite="Micah 6:8">
  He has shown you, O man, what is good: to act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with your God.
</Verse>

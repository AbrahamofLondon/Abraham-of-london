  “If You give me my life back, I’ll serve You until I’m seventy-five…” <br /> Some promises demand a price far greater than one can imagine.
</PullLine>

From the miraculous birth of a celebrated triplet in Lagos to the silent heartbreak of a father fighting for his son in London, **_Fathering Without Fear_** is a memoir forged in fire. Born in 1977, Abraham's life tracks visionary highs and devastating losses: campus politics and spiritual entanglements, immigration dead ends, and legal labyrinths — a British son kept at a distance. Denied work. Barred from public funds. Opposed at every turn. **Every reason to quit.** He didn't.

<Rule />

With **strategy and Scripture**, tears became testimony. *Fathering Without Fear* is more than a memoir: it's a blueprint for men under pressure, a declaration that **grace is a weapon**, and a father's letter to the next generation.

<PullLine subtle>
  He didn't survive by chance. He endured by **grace**.
</PullLine>

And because **something always happens**, he kept moving — even when nothing else did.

<Rule />

This is a story for the **faithful**, for the **underestimated**, and for anyone who has ever had to **fight to be seen**.

  Some promises demand a price far greater than one can imagine.


From the miraculous birth of a celebrated triplet in Lagos to the silent heartbreak of a father fighting for his son in London, **_Fathering Without Fear_** is a memoir forged in fire.

Born in 1977, Abraham&apos;s life tracks visionary highs and devastating losses: campus politics and spiritual entanglements, immigration dead ends, and legal labyrinths - a British son kept at a distance. Denied work. Barred from public funds. Opposed at every turn.

**Every reason to quit.**

He didn&apos;t.

<Rule />

With **strategy and Scripture**, tears became testimony. _Fathering Without Fear_ is more than a memoir: it&apos;s a blueprint for men under pressure, a declaration that **grace is a weapon**, and a father&apos;s letter to the next generation.


  He didn&apos;t survive by chance. He endured by **grace**.


And because **something always happens**, he kept moving - even when nothing else did.

<Rule />

This is a story for the **faithful**, for the **underestimated**, and for anyone who has ever had to **fight to be seen**.

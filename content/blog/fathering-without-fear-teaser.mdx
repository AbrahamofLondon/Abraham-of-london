  “If You give me my life back, I’ll serve You until I’m seventy-five…”
  <br />
  Some promises demand a price far greater than one can imagine.
</PullLine>

From the miraculous birth of a celebrated triplet in Lagos to the silent heartbreak of a father fighting for his son in London, <strong><em>Fathering Without Fear</em></strong> is a memoir forged in fire.

Born in 1977, Abraham’s life tracks visionary highs and devastating losses: campus politics and spiritual entanglements, immigration dead ends, and legal labyrinths — a British son kept at a distance. Denied work. Barred from public funds. Opposed at every turn.

<strong>Every reason to quit.</strong>

He didn’t.

<Rule />

With <strong>strategy and Scripture</strong>, tears became testimony. <em>Fathering Without Fear</em> is more than a memoir: it’s a blueprint for men under pressure, a declaration that <strong>grace is a weapon</strong>, and a father’s letter to the next generation.

<PullLine subtle>
  He didn’t survive by chance. He endured by <strong>grace</strong>.
</PullLine>

And because <strong>something always happens</strong>, he kept moving — even when nothing else did.

<Rule />

This is a story for the <strong>faithful</strong>, for the <strong>underestimated</strong>, and for anyone who has ever had to <strong>fight to be seen</strong>.

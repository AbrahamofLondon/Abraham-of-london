# Fathering Without Fear — Teaser

<PullLine>
  "If You give me my life back, I'll serve You until I'm seventy-five…"
  
  Some promises demand a price far greater than one can imagine.

From the miraculous birth of a celebrated triplet in Lagos to the silent heartbreak of a father fighting for his son in London, ***Fathering Without Fear*** is a memoir forged in fire.

Born in 1977, Abraham’s life tracks visionary highs and devastating losses: campus politics and spiritual entanglements, immigration dead ends, and legal labyrinths—a British son kept at a distance. Denied work, barred from public funds, opposed at every turn.

**Every reason to quit.**

He didn’t.

With **strategy and Scripture**, tears became testimony. *Fathering Without Fear* is more than a memoir: it’s a blueprint for men under pressure, a declaration that **grace is a weapon**, and a father’s letter to the next generation.

<PullLine subtle>
  He didn’t survive by chance. He endured by **grace**.

And because **something always happens**, he kept moving—even when nothing else did.

This is a story for the **faithful**, for the **underestimated**, and for anyone who has ever had to **fight to be seen**.

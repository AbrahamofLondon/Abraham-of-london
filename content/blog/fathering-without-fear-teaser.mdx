# Teaser Content
From the miraculous birth of a celebrated triplet in Lagos to the silent heartbreak of a father fighting for his son in London, **Fathering Without Fear** is a memoir unlike any other. This is the deeply personal story of Abraham of London, a man forged in the fires of divine calling and repeated trials, who refused to disappear.

Born in 1977, Abraham's life was marked by both visionary moments and devastating losses. He navigated the murky waters of campus politics, endured strange spiritual entanglements, and eventually found himself trapped in a legal nightmare in the UK, fighting for access to his British son. Denied the right to work, blocked from public funds, and facing a bitter foe, he had every reason to fold.

But instead of folding, he fought. With strategy and scripture, he turned his tears into testimonies. **Fathering Without Fear** is more than a memoir; it's a spiritual blueprint for men who keep showing up, a prophetic declaration that grace is a weapon, and a father's letter to the world.

He didn't survive by luck. He stayed by grace. And because something always happens, so does he.

This is a story for the faithful, the underestimated, and anyone who has ever had to fight to be seen.

Born in 1977, Abrahamâ€™s life tracks visionary highs and devastating losses: campus politics and spiritual entanglements, immigration dead ends, and legal labyrinths â€” a British son kept at a distance. Denied work. Barred from public funds. Opposed at every turn. **Every reason to quit.** He didnâ€™t. <Rule /> With **strategy and Scripture**, tears became testimony. *Fathering Without Fear* is more than a memoir: itâ€™s a blueprint for men under pressure, a declaration that **grace is a weapon**, and a fatherâ€™s letter to the next generation. <PullLine subtle> He didnâ€™t survive by chance. He endured by **grace**. </PullLine> And because **something always happens**, he kept moving â€” even when nothing else did. <Rule /> This is a story for the **faithful**, for the **underestimated**, and for anyone who has ever had to **fight to be seen**. <Note tone="key" title="Stay in the loop"> Want chapter drops, launch dates, and early excerpts? **[Join the list](/contact)** or read the origin piece: **â€œFathering Without Fear â€” A Memoirâ€** â†’ [/blog/fathering-without-fear](/blog/fathering-without-fear) </Note> <ResourcesCTA title="Related Reading" reads={[ { href: "/blog/reclaiming-the-narrative", label: "Reclaiming the Narrative", sub: "Court-season clarity" }, { href: "/blog/the-brotherhood-code", label: "The Brotherhood Code", sub: "Build your band of brothers" }, { href: "/blog/leadership-begins-at-home", label: "Leadership Begins at Home", sub: "Lead from the inside out" } ]} downloads={[ { href: "/downloads/Fathering_Without_Fear_Teaser-A4.pdf", label: "Teaser PDF (A4/Letter)" }, { href: "/downloads/Fathering_Without_Fear_Teaser-Mobile.pdf", label: "Teaser PDF (Mobile)" }, { href: "/downloads/Brotherhood_Starter_Kit.pdf", label: "Brotherhood Starter Kit" } ]} /> <ShareRow text="Fathering Without Fear â€” a field-memoir forged in courtrooms and prayer rooms.

# In My Father's House

<Rule />

<Verse cite="John 14:2">In my Father's house are many rooms; if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going there to prepare a place for you.</Verse>

### **The Architecture of Belonging**

When we read the King James translation of "many mansions," our modern minds drift toward real estate—townhouses in the sky, gated communities, and individual monuments to our own piety. 

But Jesus was not a celestial architect; He was the Son calling us back to the **Household**.

The Greek word used here is *monai*, from the root *meno*, meaning "to remain" or "to abide." It doesn’t describe a standalone villa; it describes a **permanent dwelling place** within a larger structure. 



### **Home, Not a Hotel**

In the ancient Near Eastern context, when a son married, he didn’t move across town. He added a room to his father’s house. The household grew, but the center remained the same. 

Jesus was promising exactly this:
* **Permanent Residence:** You are not a guest; you are a son.
* **Proximity to the Father:** Your "room" is within the Father’s immediate presence.
* **Inheritance:** You belong to the estate.

The message is clear: The Gospel is not about an upgrade in living standards; it is about an upgrade in **status**. You were an orphan; you are now an heir. You were a wanderer; you now have a place at the table.

In my Father's house, there is space for you. Not because of your merit, but because of the Son’s preparation.

### **Strategy for the Heart**

If you are feeling like an outsider in your own life—if the world feels like a rented apartment that is falling apart—remember the *monai*. 

The Father isn't preparing a "place" that is far away. He is preparing a place where you **remain** in Him.

1.  **Stop living like a tenant.** Tenants worry about being evicted. Sons know they have a permanent room.
2.  **Look for the Home.** Your true identity isn't found in your temporary zip code, but in your eternal household.

The Father’s house is open. The Son has cleared the way. Come home.

# Kingdom Strategies for a Loving Legacy: Fathering O.J.A-Y

<Verse cite="Ephesians 5:25">
  Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the Church and gave Himself up for her.
</Verse>

We often mistake the call to **sacrificial love** for *toxic attachment*.
Christ’s love for the Church was not trauma bonding — it was **redemption**.

The **love of God** is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit — not by our scars, fears, or childhood pain.
A man’s first responsibility in marriage begins **before the wedding day** — at the point of *selection* — choosing to love in alignment with kingdom principles rather than emotional deficits.

Our *death* in practical terms is a **daily death to self** — to ego, insecurity, and fear.
We live by one principle alone: **love** — for God with all our heart and soul, and for our **neighbour** as ourselves.

<Rule />

## 1) The call to die daily

The true father must first **die** — to pride, performance, and the illusion of control.
We must daily deny ourselves, take up our cross, and follow Jesus.

<PullLine subtle>
  <em>Power under submission</em>, not weakness.
</PullLine>

We are *abandoned to Love*, not driven by the *abandonment of our early lives*.
We don’t parent from pain; **we lead from healing**.
We refuse to pass on trauma to children we are meant to pass treasure to.

<Verse cite="Proverbs 13:22">
  A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children.
</Verse>

<Note tone="key" title="Legacy lens">
  That inheritance is not merely financial — it is **moral, emotional, and spiritual**.
  This is a *kingdom legacy*.
</Note>

<Rule />

## 2) Alignment before assignment

A father’s life is guided by **values aligned with divine purpose**.
No shortcuts. No compromise. No bribery, deceit, or manipulation.

Our calling demands **long-term vision** built on *eternal principles*, not short-term tactics.
Faithfulness and authenticity are **non-negotiable**.

Show up as you are — no masks — so grace can meet you where you truly stand.
When you stop hiding, **you start transforming**; God’s power perfects what honesty exposes.

<Rule />

## 3) The kingdom strategy

Before a man can build legacy, he must settle three pillars:

1. **His God** — *source of identity*
2. **His purpose** — *reason for existence*
3. **His principles** — *guardrails for decisions*

Purpose without principle breeds **ambition without direction**.
Principle without purpose becomes **rigidity without relevance**.
Fuelled by the Spirit, they produce **clarity** — and clarity births **legacy**.

<PullLine>
  Find yourself **in God**. Answer the call. Discern purpose through your core, passionate values — vectored by love and truth.
</PullLine>

When you live from that centre, your **decisions, relationships, and business dealings** reflect divine alignment.
The fruit is visible — peace, integrity, and a stable home.

<Rule />

## 4) Radical surrender. Solid commitment. No games.

We come as we are — but we do **not** remain as we were.
Transformation is not cosmetic; it is **catalytic**.

Through the Holy Spirit, we learn to lead with **humility**, govern with **integrity**, and serve with **love**.
This is the crucible where **true manhood** is forged.

If we cheat, cut corners, or manipulate outcomes, we steal the miracles only obedience can birth.
The greater miracle is not *what* God gives — it is **who He makes us**.

<Rule />

## 5) To my son, O.J.A-Y

If you start early, stay rooted in truth, and learn from my mistakes,
you will begin where I stopped — go further, reach higher, and touch lives I will never see.

<PullLine>
  **Not my fears — my faith.**<br />
  **Not my struggles — my strength.**<br />
  **Not my games — my grace.**
</PullLine>

This is the legacy I’m building: not wealth alone, but **kingdom discipline**, **emotional intelligence**, and **divine peace**.

We are raising **soldiers for the Kingdom** — men who **lead with love**, **fight with faith**, and **walk in power**.

<PullLine subtle>
  **This is our inheritance. This is the strategy.**<br />
  **No games. All grace.**
</PullLine>

<Rule />

## Final reflection

Legacy is forged in **quiet consistency** — the *unseen choices* that outlive the man who made them.

When our story is told, may it be said we **loved our wives as Christ loved the Church**,
gave ourselves daily,
and raised sons and daughters who walk in **truth and peace**.

That, my son, is **Fathering Without Fear**.

But weâ€™ve raised men who canâ€™t lead themselves, women who are emotionally exhausted, and children **discipled by algorithms** instead of truth. Thatâ€™s not an accidentâ€”itâ€™s culture. <PullLine> You canâ€™t build nations with broken homes. And you canâ€™t repair homes without first **governing yourself**. </PullLine> This isnâ€™t a trend piece. Itâ€™s ancient. Itâ€™s kingdom. Itâ€™s personal. I didnâ€™t learn this in a seminar. I learned it in the fireâ€”fighting as a father when systems stalled, standing when â€œquitâ€ felt easier. I had to **lead myself** when no one else was coming. Iâ€™ve watched institutions fail. Iâ€™ve seen courts delay. Iâ€™ve seen leaders lie. The worst collapse is when a man abandons his own standards in silence and neglect. <PullLine>Leadership begins at home. **Before that, it begins in you.**</PullLine> <Rule /> ## TL;DR â€” Start Here - Lead **yourself** before you try to lead others. - Install a simple **Rule of Life** (daily, weekly, monthly). - Trade performance for **presence**; trade noise for **order**. - Measure what matters: prayer, table, tone, and time. <Callout tone="key" title="One action today"> Pick your **daily altar time** (10â€“20 min). Put it on the calendar. Guard it. </Callout> <Rule /> ## âš” Weâ€™re Not Raising Childrenâ€”Weâ€™re Raising Standards My son isnâ€™t only a childâ€”heâ€™s a **nation-in-waiting**. If I donâ€™t show upâ€”emotionally, spiritually, structurallyâ€”I donâ€™t just fail him. **I fail his generation.** We are not spectators of elite failure; weâ€™re participants in cultural renewalâ€”or decline. <PullLine subtle> Think the solution is political? **Fix your household culture.**<br/> Long for revival? **Treat your family as the first altar God examines.** </PullLine> We donâ€™t need trend sermons; we need homes discipled with **fire** and **order**. <Rule /> ## ðŸ§± Legacy Is Built Behind Closed Doors Stop glamorizing influence while your private life is in disrepair. Stop shouting about justice while your children canâ€™t find peace. Stop performing royalty online while your character canâ€™t hold a promise. > The first nation you rule is **your household**. The first throne is **your mindset**. Identity precedes activity. Jesus didnâ€™t start with titles; He named identity: *salt, light, a city on a hill*. Act from **what you are**, not what youâ€™re trying to appear to be. <Rule /> ## A Rule of Life for Self-Government Start small. Start today. ### Daily (Non-Negotiables) 1. **Altar (10â€“20 min):** Pray, read, and state your family standard for the day out loud. 2. **Table:** One screen-free meal. Ask real questions; listen with your eyes. 3. **Order:** Make the bed, clear the sink, reset the living roomâ€”**visible order trains invisible order**. 4. **Speech:** No contempt. Bless and correct plainly, never sarcastically. ### Weekly (Rhythm) - **Sabbath:** One day without buying, hustling, or broadcasting. Worship, rest, delight. - **Service:** Serve someone who canâ€™t pay you backâ€”together. - **Council:** Spouses review the week; fathers speak vision to their children. ### Monthly (Audit) Walk the **house**, the **calendar**, and the **bank statement**. Where is chaos winning? **Close the gaps.** <PullLine>You donâ€™t drift into legacy; **you design it**.</PullLine> <Rule /> ## Household Culture Checklist (5 signals of health) - Prayer is normal, short, and **often**. - Mealtimes happen more than missed. - Tone stays firm without contempt. - Screens obey **people**, not the other way round. - Money reflects mission (giving > gadgets). <Note tone="caution" title="Common sabotage patterns"> Chronic lateness, sarcastic correction, parents outsourcing formation to apps, and â€œIâ€™m too tiredâ€ as a lifestyle. Name it. Replace it. </Note> <Rule /> <ResourcesCTA preset="leadership" /> <Rule /> ## ðŸ”¥ Final Word: Altars, Not Excuses Iâ€™m not building noise. Iâ€™m building **legacy**. Iâ€™m not performing gratitude. Iâ€™m preparing **dominion**. And I refuse to tiptoe through fatherhood, leadership, or calling. <Note tone="key" title="The Charge"> Let others chase attention. Weâ€™ll build citiesâ€” one home, one standard, one self-governed soul at a time. <br/><br/> **Exit the excuses. Enter the altar.** Hereâ€™s where nations are forged. </Note> <ShareRow text="Leadership begins at home. Govern yourself. Disciple your household.

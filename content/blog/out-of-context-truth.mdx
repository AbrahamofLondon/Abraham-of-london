# Out of Context, Out of Truth

## The Poverty of Out-of-Context Attacks

If a man spent decades of his life standing on platforms, giving voice to his convictions, logging thousands of hours in public debate, speeches, interviews—literally building his life around words spoken in the open—  
and the only thing you can do after his death is to snatch a single line out of context to prove he was a “bad person”…

You are not exposing him.  
You are exposing yourself.

You should be afraid of that impulse. Afraid of what it says about your soul. Because it doesn’t come from a place of courage, conviction, or honesty. It comes from rot.

Unless, of course, you are exactly what you show yourself to be:  
a dangerous animal, scavenging for excuses to justify the bitterness of your own miserable life.

## The Temptation to Tear Down

There’s a reason people love to tear down men like Charlie Kirk—or anyone who dares to speak plainly, take a stand, and defend something higher than themselves.

It’s easier to sneer than to self-examine.  
It’s easier to weaponize fragments of a man’s life than to confront the uncomfortable truth of your own.

But let me be clear: truth isn’t found in half-quotes or cheap shots.  
Truth is found in the light of Jesus Christ.

## The Gospel Nobody Wants to Hear

If you are genuinely seeking truth—if you are worthy of redemption—Jesus loves you. Yes, you.  

Not the polished version you pretend to be online.  
Not the version of yourself that hunts down clips to dunk on the dead.  

**You.**  
The broken, bitter, empty you.  

And here’s the gospel—raw and uncut: we are utterly unworthy. Miserably condemned already.  

> *“For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already…”*  
> — John 3:17–18  

That’s the part nobody wants to touch.  
Because it means the real problem isn’t Charlie Kirk’s words, or anyone else’s convictions.  
The real problem is your own heart.

## Why Smearing Others Won’t Save You

Until you face that—until you stare your depravity in the eye and cry out for the redemption only found in the blood of Jesus—  
you will stay exactly where you are: hopeless. Lost. Empty.

And trying to drag others down with you—calling Charlie a “bigot,” or anyone else you hate names—will never fix it.

It’s a cheap drug.  
It numbs for a moment.  
But the misery comes rushing back.  

If you’re honest, you already know this.  
You’re still empty.  
Even after throwing stones.

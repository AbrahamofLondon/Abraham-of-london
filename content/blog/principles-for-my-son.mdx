"Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it." – Proverbs 22:6

*O.J.A-Y,*

If you're reading this now, you're probably older than I am as I write these words. Maybe you're a father yourself, wondering how to raise your own son in a world that's forgotten what men are for.

# Principles for My Son: Building a Foundation of Character

O.J.A-Y, these are the truths your father lives by. Keep them close. Test them. Live them.

<Rule />

## The 12 Principles

### I. Identity & Integrity

1. **Fear God, not man.** Reverence produces wisdom; popularity produces compromise.  
2. **Guard your mind.** Attention is stewardship. Protect it from cheap stimuli and lazy thinking.  
3. **Honour your mother.** Strength never requires disrespect.  
4. **Tell the truth.** Even when it stings. **Especially then.**  
5. **Own your mistakes.** Repent quickly. Don’t hide — **heal**.

### II. Discipline & Development

6. **Choose your brothers.** Community builds or breaks destiny. Pick men who **sharpen** you.  
7. **Work before reward.** Excellence is sowing first, harvest later.  
8. **Discipline your body.** Sleep, movement, food — habits build a future your feelings can’t sabotage.  
9. **Master money.** Save, give, invest. Never worship what you’re called to steward.

### III. Mission & Legacy

10. **Protect the vulnerable.** Use strength to cover, not control.  
11. **Build altars at home.** Pray, read, sing, and talk — **presence beats performance**.  
12. **Live sent.** Your life has assignment; don’t drift — **decide**.

<Rule />

## A Father’s Promise

I will lead you by example; I will apologise when I miss it; I will never stop showing up.  
When the world shouts new definitions, we’ll open an old Book and find the **ancient paths**.

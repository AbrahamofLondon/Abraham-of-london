# Principles for My Son: Building a Foundation of Character

O.J.A-Y, these are the truths your father lives by. Keep them close. Test them. Live them.

<PullLine>**I’m raising a man, not a brand.**</PullLine>

<Rule />

## TL;DR — The Twelve in One Breath

Fear God. Guard your mind. Honour your mother. Tell the truth. Own mistakes.
Choose brothers who sharpen you. Work before reward. Discipline your body. Master money.
Protect the vulnerable. Build altars at home. Live sent.

<Callout tone="key" title="One action today">
  Choose one principle and make it visible: write it on a card, set a phone
  reminder, or speak it at the dinner table.
</Callout>

<Rule />

## I. Identity & Integrity

1. **Fear God, not man.** Reverence produces wisdom; popularity produces compromise.
2. **Guard your mind.** Attention is stewardship—protect it from cheap stimuli and lazy thinking.
3. **Honour your mother.** Strength never requires disrespect.
4. **Tell the truth.** Even when it stings. _Especially then._
5. **Own your mistakes.** Repent quickly. Don’t hide—**heal**.

<Verse cite="Proverbs 1:7">
  The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge.
</Verse>

<Rule />

## II. Discipline & Development

6. **Choose your brothers.** Community builds or breaks destiny—pick men who **sharpen** you.
7. **Work before reward.** Excellence sows first; harvest comes later.
8. **Discipline your body.** Sleep, movement, food—habits build a future your feelings can’t sabotage.
9. **Master money.** Save, give, invest. Never worship what you’re called to steward.

<Note tone="info" title="Daily micro-rule (10 minutes)">
  3 push-ups $\times$ 10, 2 glasses of water, 5 verses aloud, 60-second room
  reset. Small wins stack into strength.
</Note>

<Rule />

## III. Mission & Legacy

10. **Protect the vulnerable.** Use strength to cover, not control.
11. **Build altars at home.** Pray, read, sing, and talk—**presence beats performance**.
12. **Live sent.** Your life has assignment; don’t drift—**decide**.

<PullLine subtle>
  You carry our family name—but more than that, you carry God’s image.

<Rule />

## A Father’s Promise

I will lead you by example, apologise when I miss it, and never stop showing up.
When the world shouts new definitions, we’ll open an old Book and walk the **ancient paths** together.

<Verse cite="Jeremiah 6:16">
  Stand at the crossroads and look; ask for the ancient paths… and you will find
  rest for your souls.
</Verse>

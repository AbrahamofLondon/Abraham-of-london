# Reclaiming the Narrative: Fathers in Family Court

Courts move slowly. **Bias moves fast.** The story told about fathers is often written without them.

This piece isn’t legal advice — it’s field notes from a father who **refused to disappear**.

<Verse cite="Psalm 82:3–4">
  Defend the weak and the fatherless; uphold the cause of the poor and the oppressed.
</Verse>

<PullLine subtle>
  Your case is a chapter — not your identity. Your name is Father. Act like it.
</PullLine>

<Rule />

## Myths to Reject

<PullLine subtle>
  - **“Absent means uninterested.”** *Sometimes it means obstructed.*  
  - **“A good dad is a quiet dad.”** *False. Healthy fathers are present, principled, and documented.*  
  - **“Play nice and it will sort itself out.”** *Clarity isn’t cruelty; boundaries aren’t bitterness.*
</PullLine>

<Note tone="caution" title="Watch the framing">
  “He didn’t attend” vs “He was not informed.”  
  “He’s angry” vs “He’s protective and asked for safeguarding.”  
  Accurate language matters — now and later.

## What to Document (consistently)

**You can’t fight for truth without receipts.** Maintain rigorous records:

1. **Time & communication:** dates, calls, messages, missed time, refused access.  
2. **Involvement:** school runs, homework, meetings, medical and extracurriculars.  
3. **Financial support:** all receipts and bank records. Add useful references.  
4. **Interference:** late cancellations, withheld info, threats — **facts, not flames**.  
5. **Third-party observations:** teachers, coaches, faith leaders — brief factual notes.

## How to Show Up: Court rewards clarity

- **Be calm and prepared.** Script three headlines tied to the **child’s best interest**.  
- **Speak to outcomes.** Stability, schooling, sleep, safeguarding.  
- **Build witnesses.** People who’ve seen you show up: teachers, coaches, neighbours, leaders.  
- **Stay clean.** **No online rants.** No late-night essays. Assume everything is disclosable.

<Note tone="key" title="The B.P.F. rule">
  **Brief • Polite • Factual.** Four to six sentences and one clear ask.  
  If it’s complex, acknowledge and move to an email. Summarise calmly.
</Note>

<Rule />

## Court-Day Cadence (5 minutes)

- **Breathe:** box-breathe 4×4×4×4.  
- **Pray:** “Jesus, carry me — I choose trust.”  
- **Repeat:** your three headlines out loud.  
- **Decide:** your one ask today — specific, child-focused.

<Verse cite="Philippians 4:6–7">
  …by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God will guard your hearts and minds…
</Verse>

## What to Tell Your Son

<PullLine>
  You’re loved. I’m not leaving. Your story won’t be defined by a docket.  
  We won’t just win access. <strong>We’ll build impact.</strong> That’s the narrative.
</PullLine>

<Note tone="info" title="After the hearing (same day)">
  10 lines in your journal: outcomes, deadlines, next steps, feelings (for processing only).  
  Send your child a 60-second voice note: calm, hopeful, present.

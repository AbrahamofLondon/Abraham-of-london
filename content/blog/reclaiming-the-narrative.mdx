Courts move slowly. Bias moves fast. The story told about fathers is often written without them.

This piece isn’t legal advice—it’s field notes from a father who refused to disappear.

## Myths to Reject

- **“Absent means uninterested.”** Sometimes it means obstructed.  
- **“A good dad is a quiet dad.”** False. Healthy fathers are present, principled, and documented.  
- **“Play nice and it will sort itself out.”** Clarity isn’t cruelty; boundaries aren’t bitterness.

## What to Document (Consistently)

- Dates, calls, messages, missed time, refused access.  
- School, health, and extracurricular involvement.  
- Financial support and receipts.  
- Any threats or interference—write facts, not flames.

## How to Show Up

- **Be calm and prepared.** Court rewards clarity.  
- **Speak to the child’s best interest.** Always.  
- **Build witnesses.** Teachers, coaches, community leaders who’ve seen you show up.  
- **Stay clean.** No online rants. No reckless texts. Keep the future in mind.

## What to Tell Your Son

You’re loved. I’m not leaving. Your story won’t be defined by a docket.

**We won’t just win access. We’ll build impact.** That’s the narrative.

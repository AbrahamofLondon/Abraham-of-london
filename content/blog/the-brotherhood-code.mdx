# The Brotherhood Code: Breaking Cycles of Absence

Absent fathers aren’t replaced by louder politics. They’re replaced by **present men**.

<Verse cite="Proverbs 27:17">
  As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another.
</Verse>

<PullLine subtle>
  Brotherhood is not a chat thread. It’s a <strong>covenant of presence</strong>.
</PullLine>

<Rule />

## Why Brotherhood?

Men heal and harden in the company they keep.

A righteous brotherhood:
- Restores **standards**.  
- Strengthens **identity**.  
- Disrupts **generational drift**.

<Note tone="key" title="What we’re fighting for">
  Sons and daughters who see men show up, stay the course, and keep their word — at home, at work, and under pressure.
</Note>

<Rule />

## The Code (Keep it Simple)

<PullLine><strong>The covenant of presence and integrity.</strong></PullLine>

1. **Show up.** Weekly touchpoint. **No ghosts.**  
2. **Tell the truth.** Confess before you **collapse**.  
3. **Carry weight.** Pray, call, turn up at the door.  
4. **Protect families.** No gossip. No shortcuts. **Cover, don’t expose.**  
5. **Build together.** Study, train, serve. **Produce — not just post.**

<Note tone="caution" title="Red flags (deal with fast)">
  Chronic lateness without accountability, secret-keeping, triangulation (“he said / she said”), and spiritual one-upmanship.  
  These fracture trust. Name them early; repair or release.
</Note>

<Rule />

## Meeting Rhythm

<Note tone="key" title="Forged on purpose">
  ### Disciplined Time  
  **45 minutes:** Scripture + discussion (the foundation)  
  **30 minutes:** Formation (habits, money, marriage, parenting)  
  **15 minutes:** Intercession (names, needs, next steps)
</Note>

Strong men don’t happen by accident. They’re forged — on purpose, **together**.

<Rule />

## Start a Group in 14 Days (playbook)

**Week 1 — Seed**
- Identify **3–5 men** you respect. Share this post and ask for a **90-day pilot** commitment.
- Lock **one weekly slot** (same time/place). Public café or living room. Keep it predictable.

**Week 2 — Frame**
- Agree the **Code** (above). Read it aloud; each man signs a one-page covenant.
- Choose a **Scripture track** (e.g., Sermon on the Mount) and a **formation track** (e.g., habits & money).

**Week 3 — Forge**
- Run the rhythm for three weeks. Keep notes (wins, needs, follow-ups).  
- Elect a **timekeeper** and **scribe**. Rotate every month.

<Note tone="info" title="One-page covenant (template)">
  **We commit for 90 days** to weekly presence, truth-telling, confidentiality, practical service, and family protection.  
  We will correct in love, receive correction with humility, and escalate conflict quickly for peace.  
  Signed: ____  ____  ____  ____  Date: ____
</Note>

<Rule />

## Roles That Keep It Moving

- **Convener** — books the space, sends reminder the day before.  
- **Timekeeper** — guards the clock so content lands, not drifts.  
- **Scribe** — captures action items (1–3 per man).  
- **Chaplain** — opens/closes in prayer; coordinates care if crisis hits.

Rotate monthly so **everyone grows**.

<Rule />

## Accountability That Builds, Not Breaks

**The Stack:**
1. **Facts first.** What happened? When? What did you do / not do?  
2. **Heart next.** What were you feeling? What did you believe in that moment?  
3. **Hope last.** What’s the next right step by Friday? Who’s on your shoulder?

<PullLine>
  Accountability is not surveillance. It’s <strong>shared courage</strong>.
</PullLine>

<Rule />

## A 60-Minute Starter Agenda (Week 1)

- **Opening (5):** Welcome, purpose, prayer.  
- **Scripture (15):** Read Matthew 5:1–12. One line each: “What strikes me?”  
- **Formation (20):** Habit audit — sleep, Scripture, sweat, sunlight, support. Pick **one** micro-habit.  
- **Commitments (10):** Each man states one concrete step + deadline.  
- **Intercession (10):** Pray names and needs. Text one person encouragement before you leave.

<Verse cite="Ecclesiastes 4:9–10">
  Two are better than one… If either of them falls, one can help the other up.
</Verse>

<Rule />

## Guardrails (so it lasts)

- **Confidentiality.** Stories stay in the room.  
- **No fixing during grief.** Listen first; solutions later.  
- **Short answers, long obedience.** Keep shares tight; keep commitments strong.  
- **Serve together monthly.** A family in need, a community clean-up, a young dad to mentor.

<Note tone="caution" title="If conflict hits">
  Speak directly to the brother within 48 hours. If unresolved, bring one other man. If still stuck, pause platform privileges (leading/hosting) until peace is made.
</Note>

<Rule />

## The Outcome We’re After

- **Fathers present at the table and the touchline.**  
- **Marriages strengthened by truth and tenderness.**  
- **Young men apprenticed in skill and character.**  
- **A name that means something in your city.**

<PullLine subtle>
  The cycle breaks when men keep small promises for a long time.
</PullLine>

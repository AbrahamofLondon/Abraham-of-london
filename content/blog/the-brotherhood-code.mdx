Absent fathers aren’t replaced by louder politics. They’re replaced by present men.

## Why Brotherhood?

Men heal and harden in the company they keep. A righteous brotherhood restores standards, strengthens identity, and disrupts generational drift.

## The Code (Keep It Simple)

1. **Show up.** Weekly touchpoint. No ghosts.  
2. **Tell the truth.** Confess before you collapse.  
3. **Carry weight.** Pray, call, turn up at the door.  
4. **Protect families.** No gossip. No shortcuts. Cover, don’t expose.  
5. **Build together.** Study, train, serve. Produce—not just post.

## Meeting Rhythm

- **45 minutes Scripture + discussion**  
- **30 minutes formation** (habits, money, marriage, parenting)  
- **15 minutes intercession** (names, needs, next steps)

Strong men don’t happen by accident. They’re forged—on purpose, together.

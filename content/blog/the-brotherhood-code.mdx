# The Brotherhood Code: Breaking Cycles of Absence

Absent fathers aren’t replaced by louder politics. They’re replaced by **present men**.

---

## Why Brotherhood?

Men heal and harden in the company they keep.

A righteous brotherhood:
* Restores **standards**.
* Strengthens **identity**.
* Disrupts **generational drift**.

## The Code (Keep It Simple)

<PullLine>
  **The covenant of presence and integrity.**
</PullLine>

1.  **Show up.** Weekly touchpoint. **No ghosts.**
2.  **Tell the truth.** Confess before you **collapse**.
3.  **Carry weight.** Pray, call, turn up at the door.
4.  **Protect families.** No gossip. No shortcuts. **Cover, don’t expose.**
5.  **Build together.** Study, train, serve. **Produce—not just post.**

## Meeting Rhythm

<Note tone="key" title="Forged on Purpose">
  ### Disciplined Time
  * **45 minutes:** Scripture + discussion (the foundation)
  * **30 minutes:** Formation (habits, money, marriage, parenting)
  * **15 minutes:** Intercession (names, needs, next steps)
</Note>

Strong men don’t happen by accident. They’re forged—on purpose, **together**.

<Rule />

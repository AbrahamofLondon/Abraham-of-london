Absent fathers are not replaced by louder politics or Twitter debate. They are replaced by **present men**—men who **show up** consistently, act with **integrity**, and build **brotherhoods** anchored in truth and service.

> **“As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another.”**  
> — *Proverbs 27:17*

**Brotherhood is not a chat thread. It is a covenant of presence.**

---

## TL;DR — Run This
- Gather **3–5 men** you respect.
- Commit to a **90-day pilot** with a weekly meeting.
- Adopt the **Covenant of Presence** (below).
- Follow the **60–90 min rhythm** (Scripture → Formation → Intercession).
- **Produce, not just post**: serve together monthly and keep action lists.

## Why Brotherhood?
Men’s growth—both healing and hardening—happens in the company they keep. A righteous brotherhood:

- **Restores standards:** Rekindles responsibility and honour.  
- **Strengthens identity:** Reinforces what it means to be a present man, father, and leader.  
- **Disrupts generational drift:** Breaks destructive cycles quietly passed through families.

> **What we’re fighting for:** Sons and daughters who see men show up, stay the course, and keep their word—at home, at work, and under pressure.

## The Code (Covenant of Presence & Integrity)
1. **Show up.** Weekly touchpoints. **No ghosts.**  
2. **Tell the truth.** Confess struggles **before** you collapse.  
3. **Carry weight.** Pray, call, turn up at the door.  
4. **Protect families.** No gossip; no shortcuts. **Cover, don’t expose.**  
5. **Build together.** Study, train, serve. **Produce—not just post.**

**Red flags—deal fast:** chronic lateness without accountability, secret-keeping, triangulation (“he said / she said”), and spiritual one-upmanship. Name them early; repair or release.

---

## Meeting Rhythm (60–90 minutes)
- **45 min:** Scripture + discussion (foundation)  
- **30 min:** Formation (habits, money, marriage, parenting)  
- **15 min:** Intercession (names, needs, next steps)

Strong men aren’t found; they’re **forged—together**.

## Start a Group in 14 Days (Playbook)
**Week 1 — Seed**  
- Identify **3–5 men** you respect. Share this post and ask for a **90-day pilot**.  
- Lock one weekly slot (same time, same place). Public café or living room.

**Week 2 — Frame**  
- Read the **Code** aloud; everyone signs a one-page covenant.  
- Choose a **Scripture track** (e.g., *Sermon on the Mount*).  
- Choose a **Formation track** (habits & money).

**Week 3 — Forge**  
- Run the rhythm three consecutive weeks. Track wins, needs, and follow-ups.  
- Elect a **timekeeper** and **scribe**; rotate monthly.

> **One-page covenant (template):**  
> *We commit for 90 days to weekly presence, truth-telling, confidentiality, practical service, and family protection.  
> We will correct in love, receive correction with humility, and escalate conflict quickly for peace.*  
> **Signed:** ____  ____  ____  ____  **Date:** _____

## Roles That Keep It Moving
- **Convener:** Books space, sends reminders.  
- **Timekeeper:** Guards the clock so content lands, not drifts.  
- **Scribe:** Captures 1–3 action items per man; checks progress next week.  
- **Chaplain:** Opens/closes in prayer; coordinates care if crisis hits.

Rotate monthly so **everyone grows**.

---

## Accountability That Builds, Not Breaks
**The Stack**  
1. **Facts first:** What happened? When? What did you do—or not do?  
2. **Heart next:** What were you feeling? What did you believe in the moment?  
3. **Hope last:** What’s the next right step? Who’s your accountability partner?

> Accountability is not surveillance. It’s **shared courage**.

## A 60-Minute Starter Agenda (Week 1)
- **Opening (5 min):** Welcome, purpose, prayer.  
- **Scripture (15 min):** Read *Matthew 5:1–12 (Beatitudes)*. Each man shares one striking line.  
- **Formation (20 min):** Habit audit—sleep, Scripture, sweat, sunlight, support. Pick **one** micro-habit.  
- **Commitments (10 min):** Each states one concrete step + deadline.  
- **Intercession (10 min):** Pray names and needs. Text encouragement to one brother before leaving.

> **“Two are better than one… If either falls, one helps the other up.”**  
> — *Ecclesiastes 4:9–10*

---

## Guardrails that Make Brotherhood Last
- **Confidentiality:** Stories stay in the room.  
- **No fixing during grief:** Listen first; solutions later.  
- **Short answers, long obedience:** Keep shares concise; commitments strong.  
- **Serve monthly:** Help a family, clean a community space, or mentor a young dad.

**If conflict arises:** address within 48 hours directly; bring one other brother if unresolved; pause leadership roles until peace is made.

---

## Outcomes We’re After
- Fathers present at home and in community.  
- Marriages strengthened by truth and tenderness.  
- Young men apprenticed in skill and character.  
- A respected name in your city.

> The cycle breaks when men keep small promises over time.

## FAQ (quick hits)
**How big should the group be?**  
Three to five is ideal; small enough for honesty, big enough for momentum.

**Do we need a “leader”?**  
You need a **convener**. Rotate roles so everyone carries weight.

**What if someone stops showing up?**  
Have a direct, kind conversation within a week; clarify expectations; invite recommitment or release.

**What about single men?**  
Welcome. Presence, integrity, and service are for **all** men; fatherhood is also spiritual and communal.

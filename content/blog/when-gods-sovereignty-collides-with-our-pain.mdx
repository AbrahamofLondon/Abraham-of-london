# When God’s Sovereignty Collides With Our Pain

I didn’t sleep last night.
My mind was wrestling with a question as old as Job, but as raw as today’s news:

<PullLine>
  **What do we do with God’s sovereignty when His justice feels unreasonable?**
</PullLine>

## The Question That Shakes Faith

Charlie Kirk is gone at 31.
A father of two. A man who fought harder than most for truth in a world built on lies.

And I can’t help but ask:

<PullLine subtle>
  - If Donald Trump could have protected him with security…
  - **Is God less resourceful than Donald Trump?**
</PullLine>

That question alone shakes the rock of my faith.

## Why Truth Matters for Fathers

As Christian fathers, we cannot shrug at this. We are raising children in a world where **truth is constantly on trial**.

* Lies shape culture.
* Lies run institutions.
* Lies become the “norm” unless someone contests them.

If God expects us to engage in these conversations — and I believe He does — then we must wrestle with *how*.

<Note tone="key" title="The Father's Engagement">
  👉 **How do we fight without being crushed by the evil we confront?**
  👉 **How do we engage without losing the families we’re fighting for?**
</Note>

## My Own Encounters With Death

I have stared death in the face more times than I can count:

* A bullet at a student protest missed me and killed the bus driver standing behind me.
* I have left my body, seen my family wailing over me, then suddenly came back to life.
* I have heard my name called seconds before disaster, pulled just out of range.

I am not worthier than Charlie.
I have buried three sisters, two brothers, my father, my childhood friend Waidi, and my best brother David.

I know loss. I know pain.
And still I have clung to God’s faithfulness.

But this loss — of a man I never met — **shakes me differently**.

## Is Satan Still the "god of This World”?

Scripture calls him that (*2 Corinthians 4:4*). But Jesus defeated him at the cross. So which is it?

<PullLine subtle>
  - If Christ reigns, why is Satan still free to maim, steal, and kill?
  - If God is sovereign, why allow bullets to fly unthwarted?
  - Why does He let children grow fatherless while telling us He is the “Father to the fatherless”?
</PullLine>

These aren’t academic questions.
They are **life-and-death questions for fathers raising children in a hostile culture**.

## God’s Justice vs. Our Sense of Justice

I’ve read Job. I know the divine response:

> *“Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?”*

In other words — **we cannot fathom.**

And yet, God also invites reasoning with His children. He asks us to **seek**, to **knock**, to **wrestle**.

So here I am:
* Not afraid of death.
* Not doubting eternity.
* But demanding to understand: **is this really the best play?**

Because if God is truly sovereign, then His justice must be more than consolation.
It must be **true, right, and good — even when it feels cruel.**

---

## Why This Matters Now

Charlie said in his last post:

> *“America has changed forever.”*

I believe the world has changed forever.

And if we, as fathers, Christians, leaders, do not engage these times with **truth**, then we are complicit in lies.

<PullLine subtle>
  👉 Our children will grow up in a culture shaped by deception — and we’ll have no moral defense.
</PullLine>

---

## Final Word

I don’t have all the answers.
But I know this:

<Note tone="key" title="The Enduring Charge">
  **Truth matters because lies destroy.**
  **And fathers must engage, even when we bleed.**
</Note>

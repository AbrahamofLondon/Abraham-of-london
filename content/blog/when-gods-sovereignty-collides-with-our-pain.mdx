&lt;HeroEyebrow&gt;Faith · Field Notes for Fathers&lt;/HeroEyebrow&gt;

# When God's [Sovereignty](/lexicon/sovereignty) Collides With Our Pain

I didn't sleep last night.
My mind wrestled with a question as old as Job, and as raw as today's news:

&lt;PullLine&gt;
  **What do we do with God's sovereignty when His justice feels unreasonable?**
&lt;/PullLine&gt;

&lt;Rule /&gt;

## The Question That Shakes Faith

A public death in the headlines - a young husband and father, gone - pressed the ache again:

&lt;PullLine subtle&gt;
  If earthly power can mobilise protection at will... **is God less resourceful
  than men?**
&lt;/PullLine&gt;

That single thought can rattle a believer.

&lt;Verse refText="Job 38:4"&gt;
  "Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?"
&lt;/Verse&gt;

God's answer to Job wasn't a seminar; it was a summons to trust.

&lt;Rule /&gt;

## Why Truth Still Matters to Fathers

As Christian fathers, we cannot shrug at reality. We are raising children in a world where **truth is constantly on trial**.

- Lies shape institutions.
- Lies set norms.
- Lies stand unless someone contests them with clarity and charity.

&lt;Note&gt;
  **How do we fight without being deformed by the fight?** **How do we engage
  culture without losing the family we're fighting for?**
&lt;/Note&gt;

&lt;Rule /&gt;

## Personal Brush With Death (Why I'm Not Theorising)

I've stared death in the face:

- A bullet at a student protest missed me and killed the bus driver behind me.
- I've left my body, seen my family weep, then returned.
- I've been warned in seconds and pulled out of danger.

I've buried three sisters, two brothers, my father, my childhood friend Waidi, and my best brother David.
Loss is not theory; it's biography. And still I've clung to God's faithfulness - even when another man's death shakes me differently.

&lt;Rule /&gt;

## The Overlap We Live In

Scripture names Satan "the god of this world" (_2 Corinthians 4:4_), and yet Christ has triumphed at the cross. So which is it?

&lt;Verse refText="John 16:33"&gt;
  "In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the
  world."
&lt;/Verse&gt;

We live in the **already/not-yet**: Christ has **overcome** (already) and we still face **tribulation** (not yet ended). [Sovereignty](/lexicon/sovereignty) doesn't erase sorrow; it **locates** it inside a larger victory.

&lt;Rule /&gt;

## God's Justice vs. Our Sense of Justice

I know Job's reply - **we cannot fathom** - but God also invites reasoning. He calls us to **seek**, **knock**, and **wrestle**.

So I'm honest before Him:

- I'm not afraid of death.
- I'm not doubting eternity.
- I'm asking: **Is this truly the better story You're writing - even when it feels cruel?**

Biblically, His goodness is not the absence of pain; it's His presence and purpose **through** it.
At the cross, **injustice became salvation**. That doesn't trivialise grief; it dignifies it with meaning.

&lt;Verse refText="Romans 8:28"&gt;
  "We know that for those who love God all things work together for good..."
&lt;/Verse&gt;

&lt;Rule /&gt;

## Praxis for Fathers Under [Sovereignty](/lexicon/sovereignty)

**[Sovereignty](/lexicon/sovereignty)** is not an excuse for passivity; it's a foundation for **holy agency**.

1. **Hold your post.** In your home, church, and city - show up with order and compassion.
2. **Guard your mouth.** Truth without kindness is brutality; kindness without truth is weakness.
3. **Build receipts.** Live so your life, logs, and witnesses preach louder than allegations.
4. **Pray and plan.** Intercession + intelligent action is how faith _works_.
5. **Protect your margin.** Sleep, Scripture, sweat, sunlight, support - the habits that keep you usable.

&lt;Note&gt;
  **A 60-Second Daily Prayer** [Father](/lexicon/father), I trust Your wisdom when mine fails.
  Jesus, govern my words today; make me brave and gentle. Holy Spirit, steady my
  emotions and guide my steps. Amen.
&lt;/Note&gt;

&lt;Rule /&gt;

## When the Night Feels Long (Four Anchors)

- **Lament is holy.** Psalms give you language; use it.
- **Community is oxygen.** Don't bleed alone - text a brother, join the prayer.
- **Work the small orders.** Make the bed, clear the sink, send the kind email.
- **Speak life aloud.** Over your child, your case, your city.

&lt;PullLine subtle&gt;Suffering is not your identity. **Sonship is.**&lt;/PullLine&gt;

&lt;Rule /&gt;

## For Group Study (4 Questions)

1. Where does God's sovereignty comfort you - and where does it offend you?
2. Which habit helps you resist despair most: prayer, planning, or brotherhood? Why?
3. Where are you tempted to "win online" but lose at home?
4. What one act of faithfulness will your children feel this week?

&lt;Rule /&gt;

## Final Word

I don't have all the answers. But I know this:

&lt;PullLine&gt;
  **Truth matters because lies destroy.** **Fathers must engage - even when we
  bleed.**
&lt;/PullLine&gt;

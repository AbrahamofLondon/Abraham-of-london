# When God’s Sovereignty Collides With Our Pain

I didn’t sleep last night.
My mind wrestled with a question as old as Job, and as raw as today’s news:

<PullLine>
  **What do we do with God’s sovereignty when His justice feels unreasonable?**
</PullLine>

<Rule />

## The Question That Shakes Faith

A public death in the headlines — a young husband and father, gone — pressed the ache again:

<PullLine subtle>
  If earthly power can mobilise protection at will… **is God less resourceful than men?**
</PullLine>

That single thought can rattle a believer.

<Verse cite="Job 38:4">
  “Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?”
</Verse>

God’s answer to Job wasn’t a seminar; it was a summons to trust.

<Rule />

## Why Truth Still Matters to Fathers

As Christian fathers, we cannot shrug at reality. We are raising children in a world where **truth is constantly on trial**.

- Lies shape institutions.
- Lies set norms.
- Lies stand unless someone contests them with clarity and charity.

<Note tone="key" title="The Father’s Engagement">
  **How do we fight without being deformed by the fight?**
  **How do we engage culture without losing the family we’re fighting for?**
</Note>

<Rule />

## Personal Brush With Death (Why I’m Not Theorising)

I’ve stared death in the face:

- A bullet at a student protest missed me and killed the bus driver behind me.
- I’ve left my body, seen my family weep, then returned.
- I’ve been warned in seconds and pulled out of danger.

I’ve buried three sisters, two brothers, my father, my childhood friend Waidi, and my best brother David.
Loss is not theory; it’s biography. And still I’ve clung to God’s faithfulness — even when another man’s death shakes me differently.

<Rule />

## The Overlap We Live In

Scripture names Satan “the god of this world” (*2 Corinthians 4:4*), and yet Christ has triumphed at the cross. So which is it?

<Verse cite="John 16:33">
  “In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.”
</Verse>

We live in the **already/not-yet**: Christ has **overcome** (already) and we still face **tribulation** (not yet ended). Sovereignty doesn’t erase sorrow; it **locates** it inside a larger victory.

<Rule />

## God’s Justice vs. Our Sense of Justice

I know Job’s reply — **we cannot fathom** — but God also invites reasoning. He calls us to **seek**, **knock**, and **wrestle**.

So I’m honest before Him:

- I’m not afraid of death.
- I’m not doubting eternity.
- I’m asking: **Is this truly the better story You’re writing — even when it feels cruel?**

Biblically, His goodness is not the absence of pain; it’s His presence and purpose **through** it.
At the cross, **injustice became salvation**. That doesn’t trivialise grief; it dignifies it with meaning.

<Verse cite="Romans 8:28">
  “We know that for those who love God all things work together for good…”
</Verse>

<Rule />

## Praxis for Fathers Under Sovereignty

**Sovereignty** is not an excuse for passivity; it’s a foundation for **holy agency**.

1. **Hold your post.** In your home, church, and city — show up with order and compassion.
2. **Guard your mouth.** Truth without kindness is brutality; kindness without truth is weakness.
3. **Build receipts.** Live so your life, logs, and witnesses preach louder than allegations.
4. **Pray and plan.** Intercession + intelligent action is how faith *works*.
5. **Protect your margin.** Sleep, Scripture, sweat, sunlight, support — the habits that keep you usable.

<Note tone="key" title="A 60-Second Daily Prayer">
  Father, I trust Your wisdom when mine fails.
  Jesus, govern my words today; make me brave and gentle.
  Holy Spirit, steady my emotions and guide my steps. Amen.
</Note>

<Rule />

## When the Night Feels Long (Four Anchors)

- **Lament is holy.** Psalms give you language; use it.
- **Community is oxygen.** Don’t bleed alone — text a brother, join the prayer.
- **Work the small orders.** Make the bed, clear the sink, send the kind email.
- **Speak life aloud.** Over your child, your case, your city.

<PullLine subtle>
  Suffering is not your identity. **Sonship is.**
</PullLine>

<Rule />

## For Group Study (4 Questions)

1. Where does God’s sovereignty comfort you — and where does it offend you?
2. Which habit helps you resist despair most: prayer, planning, or brotherhood? Why?
3. Where are you tempted to “win online” but lose at home?
4. What one act of faithfulness will your children feel this week?

<Rule />

## Final Word

I don’t have all the answers. But I know this:

<PullLine>
  **Truth matters because lies destroy.**
  **Fathers must engage — even when we bleed.**
</PullLine>

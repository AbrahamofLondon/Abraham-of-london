My mind wrestled with a question as old as Job, and as raw as todayâ€™s news: <PullLine> **What do we do with Godâ€™s sovereignty when His justice feels unreasonable?** </PullLine> <Rule /> ## The Question That Shakes Faith A public death in the headlines â€” a young husband and father, gone â€” pressed the ache again: <PullLine subtle> If earthly power can mobilise protection at willâ€¦ **is God less resourceful than men?** </PullLine> That single thought can rattle a believer. <Verse cite="Job 38:4"> â€œWhere were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?â€ </Verse> Godâ€™s answer to Job wasnâ€™t a seminar; it was a summons to trust. <Rule /> ## Why Truth Still Matters to Fathers As Christian fathers, we cannot shrug at reality. We are raising children in a world where **truth is constantly on trial**. - Lies shape institutions. - Lies set norms. - Lies stand unless someone contests them with clarity and charity. <Note tone="key" title="The Fatherâ€™s Engagement"> **How do we fight without being deformed by the fight?** **How do we engage culture without losing the family weâ€™re fighting for?** </Note> <Rule /> ## Personal Brush With Death (Why Iâ€™m Not Theorising) Iâ€™ve stared death in the face: - A bullet at a student protest missed me and killed the bus driver behind me. - Iâ€™ve left my body, seen my family weep, then returned. - Iâ€™ve been warned in seconds and pulled out of danger. Iâ€™ve buried three sisters, two brothers, my father, my childhood friend Waidi, and my best brother David. Loss is not theory; itâ€™s biography. And still Iâ€™ve clung to Godâ€™s faithfulness â€” even when another manâ€™s death shakes me differently. <Rule /> ## The Overlap We Live In Scripture names Satan â€œthe god of this worldâ€ (*2 Corinthians 4:4*), and yet Christ has triumphed at the cross. So which is it? <Verse cite="John 16:33"> â€œIn the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.â€ </Verse> We live in the **already/not-yet**: Christ has **overcome** (already) and we still face **tribulation** (not yet ended). Sovereignty doesnâ€™t erase sorrow; it **locates** it inside a larger victory. <Rule /> ## Godâ€™s Justice vs. Our Sense of Justice I know Jobâ€™s reply â€” **we cannot fathom** â€” but God also invites reasoning. He calls us to **seek**, **knock**, and **wrestle**. So Iâ€™m honest before Him: - Iâ€™m not afraid of death. - Iâ€™m not doubting eternity. - Iâ€™m asking: **Is this truly the better story Youâ€™re writing â€” even when it feels cruel?** Biblically, His goodness is not the absence of pain; itâ€™s His presence and purpose **through** it. At the cross, **injustice became salvation**. That doesnâ€™t trivialise grief; it dignifies it with meaning. <Verse cite="Romans 8:28"> â€œWe know that for those who love God all things work together for goodâ€¦â€ </Verse> <Rule /> ## Praxis for Fathers Under Sovereignty **Sovereignty** is not an excuse for passivity; itâ€™s a foundation for **holy agency**. 1. **Hold your post.** In your home, church, and city â€” show up with order and compassion. 2. **Guard your mouth.** Truth without kindness is brutality; kindness without truth is weakness. 3. **Build receipts.** Live so your life, logs, and witnesses preach louder than allegations. 4. **Pray and plan.** Intercession + intelligent action is how faith *works*. 5. **Protect your margin.** Sleep, Scripture, sweat, sunlight, support â€” the habits that keep you usable. <Note tone="key" title="A 60-Second Daily Prayer"> Father, I trust Your wisdom when mine fails. Jesus, govern my words today; make me brave and gentle. Holy Spirit, steady my emotions and guide my steps. Amen. </Note> <Rule /> ## When the Night Feels Long (Four Anchors) - **Lament is holy.** Psalms give you language; use it. - **Community is oxygen.** Donâ€™t bleed alone â€” text a brother, join the prayer. - **Work the small orders.** Make the bed, clear the sink, send the kind email. - **Speak life aloud.** Over your child, your case, your city. <PullLine subtle> Suffering is not your identity. **Sonship is.** </PullLine> <Rule /> ## For Group Study (4 Questions) 1. Where does Godâ€™s sovereignty comfort you â€” and where does it offend you? 2. Which habit helps you resist despair most: prayer, planning, or brotherhood? Why? 3. Where are you tempted to â€œwin onlineâ€ but lose at home? 4. What one act of faithfulness will your children feel this week? <Rule /> ## Final Word I donâ€™t have all the answers. But I know this: <PullLine> **Truth matters because lies destroy.** **Fathers must engage â€” even when we bleed.** </PullLine> <ResourcesCTA title="Keep Building â€” Reading & Tools" reads={[ { href: "/blog/when-the-system-breaks-you", label: "When the System Breaks You", sub: "Grief â€¢ Grit â€¢ Grace" }, { href: "/blog/fathering-without-fear", label: "Fathering Without Fear â€” A Memoir", sub: "Movement, not just story" }, { href: "/blog/leadership-begins-at-home", label: "Leadership Begins at Home", sub: "Order over noise" } ]} downloads={[ { href: "/downloads/Communication_Script_BPF.pdf", label: "Brief â€¢ Polite â€¢ Factual Scripts" }, { href: "/downloads/Leadership_Playbook.pdf", label: "Leadership Playbook (30â€“60â€“90)" }, { href: "/downloads/Entrepreneur_Operating_Pack.pdf", label: "Weekly Operating Rhythm" } ]} /> <ShareRow text="Sovereignty isnâ€™t passivity.

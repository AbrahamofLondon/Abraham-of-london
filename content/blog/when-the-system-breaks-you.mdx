# When the System Breaks You: Finding Purpose in Pain

There are hits you can’t out-think. Papers served. Doors closed. Friends silent.
You don’t need slogans—you need **scaffolding**.

---

## Three Rooms to Walk Through

When the blow lands, follow this path to rebuild, not retreat:

1.  **Grief.** Name what you lost. Don’t minimize it. **Lament is holy.**
2.  **Grit.** Build a daily rule: sleep, Scripture, sweat, sunlight, support. **Repeat for 30 days.**
3.  **Grace.** Forgive wisely. Keep your heart soft and your **boundaries firm.**

## Anchors That Held Me

<PullLine>
  These are the non-negotiables that keep you from drifting.
</PullLine>

* **Scripture before screen.** First voice wins the day.
* **Document, don’t detonate.** Write facts; let time vindicate.
* **Serve someone.** **Purpose suffocates despair.**
* **Speak life.** Over your child, your case, your future.

<PullLine subtle>
  You’re not broken beyond use. **You’re being reforged.**
</PullLine>

<Rule />

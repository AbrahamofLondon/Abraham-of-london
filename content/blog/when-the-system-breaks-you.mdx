There are hits you can’t out-think. Papers served. Doors closed. Friends silent.  
You don’t need slogans—you need scaffolding.

## Three Rooms to Walk Through

1. **Grief.** Name what you lost. Don’t minimize it. Lament is holy.  
2. **Grit.** Build a daily rule: sleep, Scripture, sweat, sunlight, support. Repeat for 30 days.  
3. **Grace.** Forgive wisely. Keep your heart soft and your boundaries firm.

## Anchors That Held Me

- **Scripture before screen.** First voice wins the day.  
- **Document, don’t detonate.** Write facts; let time vindicate.  
- **Serve someone.** Purpose suffocates despair.  
- **Speak life.** Over your child, your case, your future.

You’re not broken beyond use. You’re being reforged.

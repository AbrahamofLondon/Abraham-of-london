"Though he slay me, yet will I hope in Him." – Job 13:15

There's a pain that doesn't have language.

When the system turns on you—not because you failed as a father, but because you dared to be one—it doesn't just hurt. It unmans you. Quietly. Systematically. Legally.

They don't call it warfare, but it is.

Not with bullets—but with bias, bureaucracy, and broken assumptions.

Ihave stood in courtrooms where truth was secondary to procedure. Where being a present, committed father meant nothing against cleverly spun narratives. Where the system wasn't blind—just selectively sighted.

## I Didn't Just Lose Access. I Almost Lost Myself.

You see, it's not just about visitation schedules or legal jargon. It's about identity. A man can survive injustice. What's harder is surviving being *misunderstood*—reduced to a file, labeled by strangers, treated like a threat in the very role God designed him to lead.

I remember the silence.

Nights when my prayers bounced off the ceiling. Days when hope felt like betrayal—as though expecting things to get better was mocking the evidence around me.

But somewhere in that darkness, I heard something deeper than comfort.

I heard *purpose*.

## God Doesn't Rescue You From the Fire. He Refines You Through It.

Scripture doesn't promise immunity from affliction. What it promises is *presence*.

- *Joseph* was falsely accused and imprisoned—yet rose to save a nation.  
- *David* was hunted, slandered, misunderstood—yet remained a man after God's heart.  
- *Job* lost everything—and still worshipped.  

These weren't soft men. They were forged in pain.

So if you're reading this as a father broken by the system—understand: You're not being erased. You're being *re-formed*.

> God isn't interested in cosmetic restoration. He rebuilds from the foundation.

## What Rebuilding Looked Like for Me

The transformation didn't happen overnight. It happened in the trenches of daily choices:

- I stopped begging for validation from people who never gave me a fair hearing.  
- I started documenting everything—not just for court, but for *legacy*.  
- I leaned into prayer like it was my oxygen.  
- I stopped trying to "win" and started trying to *outlast*.  

I stopped asking, "When will I be vindicated?" a

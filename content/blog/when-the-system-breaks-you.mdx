# When the System Breaks You

<Verse cite="Psalm 34:18">
  The LORD is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.
</Verse>

<Rule />

## The Collapse of Control

The moment is not when the thing breaks, but when you realize the **system designed to fix it** is hostile, inert, or utterly broken itself. It is a spiritual surrender: you lose control not just of the outcome, but of the **narrative**. They give you a number, a process, a waiting period. You become a victim in search of validation from an engine that doesn't care about the truth.

<PullLine>
  This is the devil's masterstroke: convincing you that your worth is tied to the **system's verdict**, not God's.
</PullLine>

<Rule />

## The Path Back to Sovereignty

You cannot fix the system today, but you can fix your soul. Sovereignty is not the absence of external pressure; it is the **presence of internal control**.

### 1. Locate the Altar

You have been fighting on two fronts: the visible war (court, boardroom, hospital) and the invisible one (doubt, bitterness, fear). **Stop fighting the invisible war alone.**

<blockquote>
**The LORD is close to the broken-hearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.**
</blockquote>

* **Action:** Re-establish a 10-minute daily practice of Scripture and prayer. This is not therapy; it is **recalibration**.

### 2. Choose Your Posture

* **Victim:** Demands validation from the outside. Sees the past as an excuse for the present.
* **Watchman:** Establishes standards from the inside. Uses the past as a **field manual** for the future.

We refuse the victim posture. We stand as watchmen—on duty, alert, and accountable to a higher standard.

<Rule />

## The Standard for the Storm

When the external world is noise, your internal world must be clean.

* **Anchor:** What truth is non-negotiable? (*1 John 4:18: Perfect love casts out fear.*)
* **Action:** What is the ONE structural decision I can make this week that I own 100%?
* **Accountability:** Who is the brother I call **before** I make a regrettable decision?

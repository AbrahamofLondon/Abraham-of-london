# **Fathering Without Fear**

## _The Story They Thought They Knew_

This is not a parenting manual.
This is a **war document**.

The field report of a miracle child who became a marked man.
A devoted father dragged into battles he never chose.
A legacy almost stolen - and violently reclaimed.

## **Miracle Child. Marked Man.**

From the very beginning, his life burned with quiet fire:

- a father - a teacher in Ayetoro - who refused to abandon his triplets, even when it cost everything
- a grandmother who moved in the unseen, speaking of spirits and destinies
- a sister whose death unlocked visions he did not ask for
- a brother, David, whose words - _"Something always happens"_ - became both comfort and prophecy

> They called them miracle children.
> Nobody warned them that miracles attract warfare.

**Lagos. Akure. London.**
Three cities. Three furnaces.
Three invitations to disappear.

He did not disappear.
But not everyone survived.

## **From Courtrooms to Covenants**

When the storms shifted from Nigeria's chaos to London's bureaucracy,
the battle changed costume - not intensity.

Denied the right to work.
Blocked from public funds.
Imprisoned in procedural delay.
Fighting for a British son who carries a name of kings
in a system that edits fathers out of the story quietly and efficiently.

He could have disappeared.

Instead, he did what his father did before him in Lagos:
he stood, he fought, he refused to surrender.

This is where **fatherhood** stops being sentimental
and becomes **strategic warfare**.

## **Who This Book Is For**

This is for:

- men who are tired of being told to be quiet, compliant and grateful
- fathers fighting to remain in their children's lives
- believers who have seen miracles - and also seen coffins
- women who love men like this, and want to understand the weight they carry
- anyone who has ever whispered, _"Where were You when it broke?"_

If you have ever felt:

- overlooked
- misunderstood
- falsely accused
- quietly erased

then you will recognise yourself in these pages.

## **Beyond Survival - Resurrection**

This is not the victory speech of a man who "made it."
This is a live transmission from the battlefield.

Every time they tried to bury him - he rose.
Every time they tried to silence him - he spoke.
Every time they tried to separate him from his son -
he remembered the prayer and the prophecy:

> **"Something always happens."**

### **Fathering Without Fear**

When miracles come with a price -
and the price is everything -
but the promise is eternal.

He didn't just survive the fire.
He became the flame that refuses to be extinguished.

Because no matter what comes next -
**something always happens.**
And by the grace of God...
**so does he.**

- **Abraham of London**
_Miracle Child. Marked Man. Devoted Father.
The brother who remembers.
The father who refuses to disappear._

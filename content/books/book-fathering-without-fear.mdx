# **Fathering Without Fear**

## _The Story They Thought They Knew_

This is not a parenting manual.  
This is a **war document**.

The field report of a miracle child who became a marked man.  
A devoted father dragged into battles he never chose.  
A legacy almost stolen - and violently reclaimed.

---

## **The Prayer That Changed Everything**

> **"If You give me my life back, I'll serve You until I'm seventy-five."**

He prayed that as an eight-year-old boy who had stopped breathing.  
He woke up.  
He kept his word.  
And the battle never stopped.

Born as one of the _miracle triplets_ in 1977 Lagos - twenty-seven weeks, too early, too fragile, too impossible -  
his first breath was a declaration of war against the odds.

Three became two.  
Two became legends.  
And legends, it turns out, come with a price.

---

## **Miracle Child. Marked Man.**

From the very beginning, his life burned with quiet fire:

- a father - a teacher in Ayetoro - who refused to abandon his triplets, even when it cost everything
- a grandmother who moved in the unseen, speaking of spirits and destinies
- a sister whose death unlocked visions he did not ask for
- a brother, David, whose words - _"Something always happens"_ - became both comfort and prophecy

> They called them miracle children.  
> Nobody warned them that miracles attract warfare.

**Lagos. Akure. London.**  
Three cities. Three furnaces.  
Three invitations to disappear.

He did not disappear.  
But not everyone survived.

---

## **What They Don't Tell You About Miracles**

Miracles are not soft light and gentle music.  
They are tectonic demands.

They:

- attract darkness like a floodlight in a war zone
- mark you as a target for enemies you cannot see
- cost you people you cannot afford to lose

A romance that nearly killed him.  
A marriage that tried to erase him.  
A system that quietly positioned him for elimination as a father.  
And a brother whose last words still echo in the places no one else can hear.

> **"Where was God when David died?"**  
> That question did not just break his faith.  
> It forged his purpose.

## **From Courtrooms to Covenants**

When the storms shifted from Nigeria's chaos to London's bureaucracy,  
the battle changed costume - not intensity.

Denied the right to work.  
Blocked from public funds.  
Imprisoned in procedural delay.  
Fighting for a British son who carries a name of kings  
in a system that edits fathers out of the story quietly and efficiently.

He could have disappeared.

Instead, he did what his father did before him in Lagos:  
he stood, he fought, he refused to surrender.

This is where **fatherhood** stops being sentimental  
and becomes **strategic warfare**.

---

## **What This Memoir Really Is**

At its core, _Fathering Without Fear_ is:

- a **memoir of spiritual warfare in everyday clothes**
- a **love story** between a father and a son
- a **legal and spiritual autopsy** of systems that erase men in silence
- a **tribute** to those who left early and those who stayed to fight

It is the story of:

- a boy who died and came back
- a brother who became a ghost but never stopped speaking
- a man who refused to let fear, lies or injustice write his ending

> He didn't survive by luck.  
> He stayed by grace.

---

## **Who This Book Is For**

This is for:

- men who are tired of being told to be quiet, compliant and grateful
- fathers fighting to remain in their children's lives
- believers who have seen miracles - and also seen coffins
- women who love men like this, and want to understand the weight they carry
- anyone who has ever whispered, _"Where were You when it broke?"_

If you have ever felt:

- overlooked
- misunderstood
- falsely accused
- quietly erased

then you will recognise yourself in these pages.

## **Author's Reflection**

> _"I may not know your pain.  
> I may not have walked your paths or lived your story.  
> But I, too, have walked a path many cannot imagine."_

This memoir is his vow not to waste pain -  
to turn private agony into public good,  
to honour fathers who stood their ground,  
a brother who never abandoned hope,  
and a son he refuses to abandon - at any cost.

---

## **Beyond Survival - Resurrection**

This is not the victory speech of a man who "made it."  
This is a live transmission from the battlefield.

Every time they tried to bury him - he rose.  
Every time they tried to silence him - he spoke.  
Every time they tried to separate him from his son -  
he remembered the prayer and the prophecy:

> **"Something always happens."**

### **Fathering Without Fear**

When miracles come with a price -  
and the price is everything -  
but the promise is eternal.

He didn't just survive the fire.  
He became the flame that refuses to be extinguished.

Because no matter what comes next -  
**something always happens.**  
And by the grace of God...  
**so does he.**

- **Abraham of London**  
_Miracle Child. Marked Man. Devoted Father.  
The brother who remembers.  
The father who refuses to disappear._

  Fathering Without Fear is not just a memoir—it is a declaration of survival, a
  father’s letter written in the language of fire and grace.

> “Not a plea, a standard.”

*Fathering Without Fear* is a memoir of clarity under pressure—faith lived in the open, a father’s stubborn refusal to surrender the future that bears his name.

They called him a miracle before he could walk.  
They tried to break him before he could rise.  
They underestimated him every step of the way.  

*Fathering Without Fear* is the untold memoir of Abraham of London—a triplet born too soon in 1977 Lagos, raised under the shadow of loss, and forged in fire by the deaths of siblings, betrayals of friends, and battles that blurred the line between the spiritual and the political.  

It is the story of a boy who bargained with God at eight, a young man who toppled political strongholds at university, and a father who found himself silenced by courts, systems, and the cold walls of restricted contact.  

But silence did not erase him. It sharpened him.  
When denied the right to work, he built strategy.  
When stripped of funds, he fought with faith.  
When pushed out of his son’s life, he learnt to write to battle.  

This memoir doesn’t ask for sympathy—it demands attention.  
It is raw, luminous, and unrelenting: a journey from miracle child to movement-maker, from whispered losses to a roar of resilience.  

He didn’t survive by chance. He stayed by grace.  
And because something always happens—so does he.  

Read it, and you will ache when it ends, beg for more, and never forget the man who refused to disappear.

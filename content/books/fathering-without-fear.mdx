# Fathering Without Fear  
## *The Story They Thought They Knew*

This is not a parenting guide.  
It is a battlefield record.

It is the story of a miracle child turned marked man...  
A devoted father betrayed by systems...  
A legacy threatened — and defended.

> **"If You give me my life back, I’ll serve You until I’m seventy-five."**

He prayed that as a dying eight-year-old.  
He lived long enough to keep his word.

It’s not just about surviving the storm—  
It’s about fathering **through** it.  
This is faith in motion, justice in the flesh, and memory on fire.

And this time —  
He’s telling the story himself. With no permission required.

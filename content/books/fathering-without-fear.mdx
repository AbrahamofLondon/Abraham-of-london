# **Fathering Without Fear**  
## *The Story They Thought They Knew*

This is not a parenting manual.  
This is a **war document**.

The field report of a miracle child who became a marked man.  
A devoted father dragged into battles he never chose.  
A legacy almost stolen — and violently reclaimed.

---

## **The Prayer That Changed Everything**

> **"If You give me my life back, I’ll serve You until I’m seventy-five."**

He prayed that as an eight-year-old boy who had stopped breathing.  
He woke up. He kept his word.  
And the battle never stopped.

Born as one of the **“miracle triplets”** in 1977 Lagos — twenty-seven weeks, too early, too fragile, too impossible — his first breath was a declaration of war against the odds.

Three became two.  
Two became legends.  
And legends, it turns out, come with a price.

## **Miracle Child. Marked Man.**

From the start, his life was surrounded by fire:

- A teacher (his father) in Ayetoro who refused to abandon his triplets, even when the cost was everything.  
- A grandmother who moved in the unseen world, speaking of spirits and destinies.  
- A sister whose death cracked open visions he couldn’t explain.  
- A brother, David, whose words — *“Something always happens”* — would become both comfort and prophecy.

> They called them miracle children.  
> Nobody warned them miracles attract warfare.

Lagos. Akure. London.  
Three cities. Three furnaces. Three chances to disappear.

He didn't survive them all, he thrived. Not everyone did.

## **What They Don’t Tell You About Miracles**

Miracles are not soft light and gentle music.  
They are fault lines.

They:

- attract darkness like a floodlight in a war zone  
- mark you as a target for things you cannot see  
- cost you people you cannot afford to lose  

A romance that almost killed him.  
A marriage that tried to erase him.  
A system that tried to make him disappear as a father.  
And a brother whose last words still echo in the places nobody sees.

> **"Where was God when David died?"**  
> That question did not just break his faith.  
> It forged his purpose.

## **From Courtrooms to Covenants**

When the storms shifted from Nigeria’s chaos to London’s cold bureaucracy, the battle changed shape — but also increased intensity.

Denied the right to work.  
Blocked from public funds.  
Pulled into a legal maze designed to exhaust him.  
Fighting for a British son who carries the name of kings in a system that quietly edits fathers out of the story.

He could have disappeared.  
Instead, he did what his father before him did in Lagos:

- stood his ground  
- fought for his child  
- refused to surrender to a system that called him disposable  

This is where **fatherhood** stops being sentimental and becomes **strategic warfare**.

## **What This Memoir Really Is**

At its core, *Fathering Without Fear* is:

- a **memoir of spiritual warfare** in everyday clothes  
- a **love story** between a father and a son, written in tears and court dates  
- a **legal and spiritual autopsy** of systems that quietly erase men of faith  
- a **tribute** to those who left too early and those who stayed to fight  

It is the story of:

- a boy who died and came back  
- a brother who became a ghost but never stopped speaking  
- a man who refused to let fear, failure, or injustice write his final chapter  

> He didn’t survive by luck.  
> He stayed by grace.

## **Who This Book Is For**

This is for:

- men who are tired of being told to be quiet and be grateful  
- fathers fighting to remain in their children’s lives against packaged hostility  
- believers who have seen miracles — and also seen coffins  
- women who love men like this and want to understand the weight they carry  
- anyone who has ever looked at heaven and asked, *“Where were You when it broke?”*

If you have ever felt:

- overlooked  
- misunderstood  
- falsely accused  
- quietly erased  

…then you will recognise yourself in these pages.

## **Author’s Reflection**

> *“I may not know your pain.  
> I may not have walked your paths or lived your story.  
> But I, too, have walked a path many cannot imagine.”*

This memoir is his way of refusing to waste pain.  
Of turning private agony into public goods.  
Of honouring fathers who never abandoned their children,  
a brother who never abandoned hope,  
and a son he refuses to abandon — no matter the cost.

## **Beyond Survival — Resurrection**

This is not a tale of a man who “made it” and now speaks from safety.  
This is a live transmission from the battlefield.

Every time they tried to bury him, he rose.  
Every time they tried to silence him, he spoke.  
Every time they tried to cut him off from his son,  
he remembered the prayer of an eight-year-old and the words of a brother:

> **“Something always happens.”**

**FATHERING WITHOUT FEAR**  

When miracles come with a price —  
and the price is everything —  
but the promise is eternal.

He didn’t just survive the fire.  
He became the flame that refuses to be extinguished.

Because no matter what comes next —  
**something always happens.**  
And by the grace of God…  
**so does he.**

— **Abraham of London**  
*Miracle Child. Marked Man. Devoted Father.  
The brother who remembers.  
The father who refuses to disappear.*

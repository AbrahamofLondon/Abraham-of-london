# **FATHERING WITHOUT FEAR**
*A Memoir That Defies Every Boundary*

---

## **"If You give me my life back, I'll serve You until I'm seventy-five."**

*The prayer of an eight-year-old boy who died... and came back.*

*But some promises cost more than you know.*

---

**THEY CALLED US THE MIRACLE TRIPLETS.**

Born at 27 weeks in 1977 Lagos. Too early. Too poor. Too impossible.

*Three became two.*

*Two became legends.*

*But legends come with a price.*

---

**LAGOS. AKURE. LONDON.**

*Three cities. Three fires. Three chances to disappear.*

*He survived them all.*

*Not everyone did.*

---

## **"Something always happens."**

*David used to say it when hope felt like a lie.*

*He said it until 2003.*

*Until he couldn't say it anymore.*

*Until the brother who was never a cousin became a ghost.*

*Until the words became prophecy.*

---

**WHAT THEY DON'T TELL YOU ABOUT MIRACLES:**

*They attract darkness like light attracts moths.*

*They make you a target for things you can't see.*

*They cost you people you can't afford to lose.*

---

*A grandmother who spoke to spirits...*

*A sister whose death unlocked visions...*

*A romance that nearly killed him...*

*A marriage that tried to erase him...*

*A son he's still fighting to father...*

**And a brother whose last words still echo in the silence.**

---

## **"Where was God when David died?"**

*The question that broke his faith.*

*The question that forged his purpose.*

*The question that led him to a courtroom in London...*

*Fighting for a son who carries the name of kings.*

*Fighting against a system designed to make fathers disappear.*

---

**SOME STORIES CHOOSE YOU.**

*This one chose him at birth.*

*Marked him at eight.*

*Nearly destroyed him at thirty.*

*And won't let him go.*

---

*"This isn't just survival. It's resurrection."*

**Every time they tried to bury him, he rose.**

**Every time they tried to silence him, he spoke.**

**Every time they tried to separate him from his son...**

**He remembered the promise.**

**FATHERING WITHOUT FEAR**

*When miracles come with a price*

*And the price is everything*

*But the promise is eternal*

---

**He didn't just survive the fire.**

**He became the flame that refuses to be extinguished.**

---

*"Because no matter what comes nextâ€”*

*Something always happens.*

*And by the grace of God...*

*So do I."*

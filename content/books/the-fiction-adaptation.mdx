> *“There is a war in the heart of London. It is fought with silence, strategy, and an impossible grace.”*  
> *“Love will not make me smaller.”*

### Teaser

This isn’t about falling in love; it’s about **building** it.

**Davidson Adeyemi** is an architect of order—a strategist who has turned survival into systems. After near-misses and one quiet, brutal surrender, he writes a vow in the margins of his life: **love will not make me smaller**.

Then London throws him **Mara Solace**—a producer who leads with her gut and her God, a woman with a spine like steel and a calendar that hums. She doesn’t do maybes.

Together they make a beautiful mistake: they attempt a **contract romance**—clear clauses, clean exits, boundaries with teeth. For a while it works. Then the city whispers. History knocks. Desire collides with discipline. The fortress they’ve built becomes their greatest test.

Can two people trained to fight alone **stand together**?

### Logline

A brilliant London strategist must dismantle the walls that once kept him safe or lose the only woman capable of matching his conviction.

### Core Characters

- **Davidson Adeyemi — The Architect.** Systems genius, eldest-son gravity; impeccable at structure, apprenticing himself to feeling.  
- **Mara Solace — The Producer.** Warm, exacting, allergic to ambiguity; faith as craft, boundaries as tools.  
- **Emmanuel Grant — The Ghost.** Eli’s friend and mirror; sees fracture lines before they split.  
- **Sera Dlamini — The Seer.** Mara’s producing partner; a romantic with a cynic’s eye who spots dangerous cuts before the scene begins.

### Season One Arc

1) **The Agreement** — They negotiate a working romance (clauses, check-ins, exits). Heat flickers under glass.  
2) **The Breach** — A ghost from Eli’s past stresses the pact. Trust or retreat? London watches.  
3) **Consent as Design** — Desire by blueprint: adult, exact, slow. A boundary holds—barely.  
4) **Proximity** — Distance seduces; they choose presence as a discipline. The myth machine wakes.  
5) **The Mirror Clause** — Repair is practiced, not performed; a public table read burns with subtext.  
6) **Witness** — A dinner where faith is a verb; a kind line drawn with an edge.  
7) **Public Offering** — A viral misread; lucrative offers to sell the “cute couple” brand. They refuse.  
8) **Standards** — Deadline hits. Not perfect—**decided**. They choose the smaller room with the cleaner deal.

### The Ritual Engine — *The Retros*

End-of-episode fuse; same table, two mugs, no phones.

- **Promise** — What did we say we’d do?  
- **Practice** — What did we actually do?  
- **Repair** — What must we fix before tomorrow?

**Formal variant:** **Intention / Evidence / Amendment (owner + date)**  
**High-heat add-on:** **Cost** — What will this choice cost, and are we paying it on purpose?

When the world intrudes, the Retro migrates—to a car, a green room, a rain-slicked walk—same questions, new pressure.

### Themes & Motifs

- **Love as discipline** — devotion that keeps its shape under heat  
- **The cost of control** — order as beauty and danger  
- **Faith as syntax** — embodied, unperformed, a quiet anchor  
- **Intimacy as architecture** — clauses, kitchens, night walks; the design language of staying

### Cold Open (Pilot)

Black. Two sounds: a kettle mounting; a phone vibrating—once, twice, then still.

Light finds a small kitchen. Eli stops the kettle before it screams. Two mugs, equal distance apart. He weighs a text and doesn’t send it.  
The door opens. Mara enters—late, but within the window.

> **MARA** *(hanging her coat)*  
> Can we tell the truth before we get tired?

> **DAVIDSON**  
> It’s written on our ledger.

She smiles. The scene is not about tea.

> *He doesn’t fall in love; he stands in it.*

### Teaser

Eli Adeyemi reads systems for a living—quiet rooms, hard numbers, soft power. After near-misses and a brief, bruising marriage, he writes a private rule: **love must never make him smaller**.

Then he meets **Mara Solace**—a producer with a spine, a calendar, and a faith she wears like muscle memory. What begins as a clear agreement—clauses, check-ins, clean exits—turns into a risk: can desire live inside discipline and still breathe? London tightens. Work tests them. History presses in. The standard holds: say what you mean; do what you say; **stay**.

*A fully fictional romance told with the grammar of adulthood—intimate, luminous, and built for the screen.*

### Logline

### Season One — Episode Beats

1. **Clauses** — A “working romance” with rules that keep heat from burning the room down.  
2. **Friction** — Work intrudes; control masquerades as care.  
3. **Heat** — Desire, designed; consent made beautiful.  
4. **Static** — Distance tempts; presence becomes a discipline.  
5. **Mirror** — A past echo returns; repair is practiced, not performed.  
6. **Witness** — A dinner where faith is a quiet verb.  
7. **Fault Line** — A public misread; they refuse to become a brand.  
8. **Standards** — Not perfect—**decided**. A future written in time, not talk.

### Themes & Motifs

- **Devotion with edges** — love that keeps shape under pressure  
- **Adult romance** — clarity as seduction; consistency as intimacy  
- **Faith as grammar** — subtle, lived, never preached  
- **The craft of staying** — rituals, retros, repair

### Cold Open (Pilot)

Black. A kettle begins to sing; a phone buzzes once, then twice, then stops.  
A small London kitchen. Eli takes the kettle off before it screams. Two mugs, equal distance apart. He waits. He almost texts. He doesn’t. The door opens. Mara steps in—late, but inside the hour.

> **MARA** (hanging up her coat)  
> Do we still have time to tell the truth before we’re tired?

> **ELI**  
> We scheduled it.

She smiles. The scene is not about tea.

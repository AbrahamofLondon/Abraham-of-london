> *He doesn’t fall in love. He stands in it.*

### Teaser

Eli Adeyemi is a strategist who can read a balance sheet from across the room and a silence from across a lifetime. After a trail of near-misses and one brief, bruising marriage, he writes a private rule: **love must never make him smaller**.

Enter **Mara Solace**—a producer with a spine, a calendar, and a faith she practices like muscle memory. What begins as a neat proposal—clear clauses, clean exits, weekly retros—turns into a risky experiment: can desire live inside discipline without suffocating? London becomes a pressure chamber. Work tests them. History crowds the frame. And still, the standard holds: say what you mean; do what you say; **stay**.

*A fully fictional romance told with the grammar of adulthood—intimate, luminous, and built for the screen.*

### Logline

A disciplined London strategist must unlearn the habits that kept him safe to love a woman who matches his conviction—or watch the future he’s designed collapse under the weight of honesty.

### Season One — Logline Beats

1. **Clauses** — The “working romance”: rules that keep heat from burning the room down.  
2. **Friction** — Work intrudes; control masquerades as care.  
3. **Heat** — Desire, designed; consent made beautiful.  
4. **Static** — Distance tempts; they choose presence as a discipline.  
5. **Mirror** — A past echo returns; repair is practiced, not performed.  
6. **Witness** — A dinner where faith is a quiet verb.  
7. **Fault Line** — A public misread; they refuse to become a brand.  
8. **Standards** — Not perfect, **decided**: a future written in time, not talk.

### Themes & Motifs

- **Devotion with edges** — love that keeps shape under pressure  
- **Adult romance** — clarity as seduction; consistency as intimacy  
- **Faith as grammar** — subtle, lived, never preached  
- **Craft of staying** — rituals, retros, repair

### Cold Open (Pilot)

A black screen. Two sounds: a kettle beginning to sing, and a phone buzzing—once, then again, then not at all.  
Lights up on a small London kitchen. Eli turns off the kettle before it screams. He places two mugs on the table, equally spaced. He waits. He almost texts. He doesn’t. The door opens. Mara steps in, late but inside the hour.  

> **MARA** (hanging up her coat)  
> Do we still have time to tell the truth before we’re tired?

> **ELI**  
> We scheduled it.

She smiles. The scene is not about tea.

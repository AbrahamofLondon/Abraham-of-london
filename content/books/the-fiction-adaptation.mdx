# The Fiction Adaptation  
## *When fiction tells what the truth cannot.*

She was magnetic.  
He was principled.  
Together: unstoppable, unforgettable — and ultimately, combustible.

This version is uncensored.  
No counsel. No court. No consequences.

Here, every chapter risks everything —  
And every character is guilty of the truth.

> **This isn’t therapy — it’s narrative warfare.**

What was once lived is now weaponized.  
What was spoken in pain is now crafted in power.  
Some stories defend themselves.  
This one **defies the record** — and rewrites it.

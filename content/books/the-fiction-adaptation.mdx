> *“There is a war in the heart of London—fought with banter, boundaries, and a ridiculous amount of tea.”*  
> *“Love will not make me smaller.”*

## Teaser

This isn’t about falling in love; it’s about **building** it.

**Davidson Adeyemi** (Nigerian-British), an elegant systems thinker, turns survival into structure. After one quiet, brutal surrender, he vows: **love will not make me smaller**.

London throws him **Mara Solace** (South African-British), a producer with a steel spine and a sunlit laugh. She makes plans **and** room for God. She doesn’t do maybes.

They make a beautiful mistake: a **contract romance**—clear clauses, weekly retros, healthy guardrails. It works… until it doesn’t. The city whispers. History knocks. Desire collides with discipline. Their fortress becomes their test.

**Can two tacticians trained to fight alone, finally stand together?**

## Logline

A brilliant London strategist must dismantle the walls that kept him safe—or lose the only woman who can match his courage, his faith, and his standards.

## Core Cast (Colourful, modern, London)

- **Davidson Adeyemi — “The Architect.”** Nigerian-British, eldest-son gravity, immaculate notebooks; brilliant at structure, apprenticing himself to feeling.  
- **Mara Solace — “The Producer.”** South African-British, warm and exact; faith as craft, boundaries as tools, agenda in Notes app.  
- **Emmanuel Grant — “The Mirror.”** Jamaican-British counsellor-in-training; Davidson’s oldest friend, the one who spots hairline fractures.  
- **Sera Dlamini — “The Seer.”** Mara’s producing partner (Eswatini roots); romantic with a cynic’s eye, allergic to cheap spectacle.  
- **Auntie Funmi Adeyemi.** Matriarch, runs a Peckham salon, reads people like receipts.  
- **Rabbi Cohen.** Downstairs neighbour who waters plants and wisdom.  
- **Ayo & Nandi.** The pray-then-play church couple who host loud dinners and quiet salvations.

> **Representation note:** The cast mirrors London’s real streets—African, Caribbean, Jewish, South Asian, Eastern European—without tokenism. Faith appears as **practice** (meals, prayers, mercy), not performance.

## Season One Arc (High-appeal beats)

1) **The Agreement** — They design a relationship with check-ins, exits, and a “retro” ritual. Sparks through spreadsheets.  
2) **The Breach** — A past promise returns; a boundary is tested; the city (and group chat) watches.  
3) **Consent as Chemistry** — Desire by blueprint: adult, exact, slow. Saying “not yet” makes **now** stronger.  
4) **Proximity** — Long days, longer stares; rumours fly; they choose presence over performance.  
5) **The Mirror Clause** — Public table read. Subtext everywhere. Repair is practiced, not performed.  
6) **Witness** — A Friday-night dinner where faith is a verb; kindness with an edge.  
7) **Public Offering** — Viral misread; brand deals to sell the “cute couple.” They refuse the counterfeit.  
8) **Standards** — Deadline hits. Not perfect—**decided**. They choose the smaller room with the cleaner deal.

## The Ritual Engine — *The Retros*

End-of-episode fuse; same table, two mugs, no phones.

- **Promise** — What did we say we’d do?  
- **Practice** — What did we actually do?  
- **Repair** — What must we fix before tomorrow?

**Variant:** *Intention / Evidence / Amendment (owner + date)*  
**High-heat add-on:** *Cost* — What will this choice cost, and are we paying it **on purpose**?

When life intrudes, the Retro migrates—to a car, a green room, a rain-slicked walk—same questions, new pressure.

---

## Themes & Motifs (Popular, not preachy)

- **Love as discipline** — devotion that keeps its shape under heat  
- **The cost of control** — order as beauty *and* danger  
- **Faith as syntax** — prayers as breath, forgiveness as muscle memory  
- **Intimacy as architecture** — clauses, kitchens, night walks; the design language of staying

## Cold Open (Pilot)

Black. Two sounds: a kettle mounting; a phone buzz—once, twice, still.

Light finds a small kitchen. Davidson stops the kettle before it screams. Two mugs, equal distance apart. He drafts a text. Deletes.  
The door opens. Mara slips in—late, but within the agreed window.

> **MARA** *(hanging her coat; a smile)*  
> Tell the truth before we get tired?

> **DAVIDSON**  
> It’s written on our ledger.

The scene is not about tea.

## Marketing Hooks

- **Trope+Twist:** Contract romance… with healthy consent that’s actually thrilling.  
- **The Quote:** “**Boundaries are the plot.**”  
- **Audience Bridges:** Fans of *Bridgerton*, *Normal People*, *Modern Love*, *From Scratch*, and anyone who wants adult romance with craft.

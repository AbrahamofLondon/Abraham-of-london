> *“He didn’t fall in love. He stood in it.”*

### Teaser

Eli Adeyemi can read systems, not people. After a decade of near-misses—a confidante who crosses the line, a polished benefactor whose generosity hides leverage, a rebel who mistakes adventure for intimacy, and a brief, bruising marriage—he’s left with ruins and a vow: **love will not make him smaller**.

Then comes **Mara Solace**—a producer with a spine and a calendar. Together they attempt a standards-driven romance: clear clauses, real faith, boundaries with teeth. *The Fiction Adaptation* is a fully fictional, high-stakes love story that moves from misfire to mastery, from collapse to craft. It’s intrigue and tenderness, risk and repair—proof that you can raise a life, a legacy, even an **empire**, without losing your soul.

### Logline

A disciplined London strategist must unlearn survival habits forged in past entanglements and a failed marriage to love a woman who matches his conviction—or lose the future he’s been building since boyhood.

### Themes & Setting

- **Devotion vs. desire** — heat with boundaries  
- **Standards under pressure** — ethics vs. loneliness, money, status  
- **Faith, quietly lived** — grammar, not genre  
- **Setting:** contemporary London with international edges  
- **Tone:** intimate, luminous, cinematic

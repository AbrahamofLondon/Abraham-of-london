> *He does not fall into love; he stands within its architecture.*

### Teaser

Eli Adeyemi reads systems better than people. After near-misses—affection that turned to leverage, generosity that arrived with a bill, adventure confused for intimacy—and a brief, bruising marriage, he writes a private edict: **love will not make him smaller**.

Then comes **Mara Solace**—a producer with a spine, a schedule, and a faith practiced like craft. They attempt a standards-driven romance: clauses, check-ins, exits that aren’t threats. What begins as clean engineering becomes risk: can desire flourish inside discipline without losing its heat? London applies pressure. Work intrudes. History taps the glass. The vow remains—**say what you mean, and do it**.

*A romance in the grammar of maturity—intimate, luminous, screen-ready.*

---

### Logline

A disciplined London strategist must dismantle the defenses that once kept him safe to love a woman who matches his conviction—or watch the future he has been building since boyhood collapse to optics and noise.

### Core Characters

- **Eli Adeyemi** — A systems savant and eldest-son center of gravity; brilliant at structure, apprenticing himself to feeling.  
- **Mara Solace** — A producer who treats boundaries like tools; warm, exacting, allergic to ambiguity.  
- **Noah Price** — Eli’s confidant; surgical wit, calibrated ethics; sees the fracture line before it splits.  
- **Sera Dlamini** — Mara’s closest collaborator; realist about romance, believer in costs paid on purpose.

### Season One — Episode Titles & Hooks

**1) TERMS & CONDITIONS**  
They design a “working romance.” Ten-week development window starts.  
*Public arena:* a small pitch where they refuse to sell a “cute couple” brand.  
*Retro button:* **Promise. Practice. Repair.** → Add “unscheduled joy” to the calendar.

**2) FORCE MAJEURE**  
Work “care” becomes control; a PR exec offers access if they play optics.  
*Public arena:* notes session pushing chemistry on camera.  
*Retro tweak:* add **Cost** for the first time.

**3) CONSENT AS DESIGN**  
Heat by blueprint—quiet, specific, adult. A boundary holds—barely.  
*Public arena:* closed-door dinner; someone tries to “manage” Mara via Eli.  
*Retro button:* each writes one sentence they won’t say to anyone else this week.

**4) PROXIMITY**  
Distance seduces; they choose presence as a discipline. Myth machine wakes.  
*Public arena:* podcast invite to posture as “relationship experts.” Decline.  
*Retro button:* **Evidence** forces a named omission.

**5) THE MIRROR CLAUSE**  
A past echo returns; repair is practiced, not performed. The clock halves.  
*Public arena:* table read where subtext burns.  
*Retro button:* a concrete **Amendment** (owner + date).

**6) WITNESS**  
A dinner where faith is a verb. Kind line, drawn with an edge.  
*Public arena:* family table interrogates their clauses.  
*Retro button:* name the standard they’ll break *last*.

**7) PUBLIC OFFERING**  
A misread goes viral. Offers arrive to sell a cheaper story. They refuse.  
*Public arena:* industry gala—microphones, optics, traps.  
*Retro button:* no table left; they sit on the floor and keep the ritual anyway.

**8) STANDARDS**  
Deadline hits. Not perfect—**decided**. They pick the smaller room with the cleaner deal.  
*Public arena:* final pitch on their terms.  
*Retro button (final):* **Promise. Practice. Repair.** → “Keep the table.”

### The Ritual Engine — **The Retros**

Use at episode ends; it’s the show’s fuse.

**Primary set:**  
1) **Promise** — What did we say we would do?  
2) **Practice** — What did we actually do?  
3) **Repair** — What must we fix before tomorrow?

**Alt set (formal):**  
1) **Intention** — State the standard.  
2) **Evidence** — Name the facts.  
3) **Amendment** — Owner + deadline.

**Occasional fourth (high heat only):**  
**Cost** — What will this choice cost, and are we paying it on purpose?

> Staging: same table, no phones, two mugs set equal distance apart. Public episodes force the Retro into a car, green room, or night walk—same questions, new pressure.

### Themes & Motifs

- **Devotion with edges** — affection that keeps its shape under duress  
- **Adult romance** — clarity as allure; constancy as the deepest intimacy  
- **Faith as syntax** — understated, embodied, never performative  
- **The artistry of endurance** — habit, repair, and the refusal to sell out

### Cold Open (Pilot)

Black. Two sounds: a kettle building; a phone vibrating—once, twice, then still.  
Light lifts on a modest kitchen. Eli silences the kettle before its cry. Two mugs on the table, perfectly spaced. He waits. He considers a text. He doesn’t send it.  
The door opens. Mara enters—late, but within the window.

> **MARA** *(hanging her coat)*  
> Can we tell the truth before we get tired?

> **ELI**  
> It’s written on our ledger.

She smiles. The scene is not about tea.

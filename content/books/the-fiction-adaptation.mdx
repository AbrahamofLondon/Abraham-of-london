After one quiet, brutal surrender, he vows: **love will not make me smaller**. London throws him **Mara Solace** (South African-British), a producer with a steel spine and a sunlit laugh. She makes plans **and** room for God. She doesnâ€™t do maybes. They make a beautiful mistake: a **contract romance**â€”clear clauses, weekly retros, healthy guardrails. It worksâ€¦ until it doesnâ€™t. The city whispers. History knocks. Desire collides with discipline. Their fortress becomes their test. **Can two tacticians trained to fight alone, finally stand together?** --- ## Logline A brilliant London strategist must dismantle the walls that kept him safeâ€”or lose the only woman who can match his courage, his faith, and his standards. --- ## Series Snapshot (Streaming-ready) - **Format:** Limited series, **8Ã—45** - **Tone:** Romantic dramedy with prestige edges â€” witty, soulful, a little dangerous - **Vibe:** *Bridgerton*â€™s swoon meets *The Bear*â€™s discipline, with *Modern Love*â€™s grounded heart - **Setting:** Multicultural London â€” Canary Wharf glass, Brixton nights, Thames-path kitchens, Peckham salons, Hampstead quiet - **Rating:** TV-14/MA border (mature themes, restrained intimacy, no gratuitous content) - **Hooks:** Contract romance â€¢ healthy consent thatâ€™s actually hot â€¢ â€œfaith practiced, not performedâ€ â€¢ big-city family/community - **Audience Promise:** Smart banter, slow-burn chemistry, grown-up boundaries, and emotional payoff --- ## Core Cast (Colourful, modern, London) - **Davidson Adeyemi â€” â€œThe Architect.â€** Nigerian-British, eldest-son gravity, immaculate notebooks; brilliant at structure, apprenticing himself to feeling. - **Mara Solace â€” â€œThe Producer.â€** South African-British, warm and exact; faith as craft, boundaries as tools, agenda in Notes app. - **Emmanuel Grant â€” â€œThe Mirror.â€** Jamaican-British counsellor-in-training; Davidsonâ€™s oldest friend, the one who spots hairline fractures. - **Sera Dlamini â€” â€œThe Seer.â€** Maraâ€™s producing partner (Eswatini roots); romantic with a cynicâ€™s eye, allergic to cheap spectacle. - **Auntie Funmi Adeyemi.** Matriarch, runs a Peckham salon, reads people like receipts. - **Rabbi Cohen.** Downstairs neighbour who waters plants and wisdom. - **Ayo & Nandi.** The pray-then-play church couple who host loud dinners and quiet salvations. > **Representation note:** The cast mirrors Londonâ€™s real streetsâ€”African, Caribbean, Jewish, South Asian, Eastern Europeanâ€”without tokenism.

Sparks through spreadsheets. 2) **The Breach** â€” A past promise returns; a boundary is tested; the city (and group chat) watches. 3) **Consent as Chemistry** â€” Desire by blueprint: adult, exact, slow. Saying â€œnot yetâ€ makes **now** stronger. 4) **Proximity** â€” Long days, longer stares; rumours fly; they choose presence over performance. 5) **The Mirror Clause** â€” Public table read. Subtext everywhere. Repair is practiced, not performed. 6) **Witness** â€” A Friday-night dinner where faith is a verb; kindness with an edge. 7) **Public Offering** â€” Viral misread; brand deals to sell the â€œcute couple.â€ They refuse the counterfeit. 8) **Standards** â€” Deadline hits. Not perfectâ€”**decided**. They choose the smaller room with the cleaner deal. --- ## The Ritual Engine â€” *The Retros* End-of-episode fuse; same table, two mugs, no phones. - **Promise** â€” What did we say weâ€™d do? - **Practice** â€” What did we actually do? - **Repair** â€” What must we fix before tomorrow? **Variant:** *Intention / Evidence / Amendment (owner + date)* **High-heat add-on:** *Cost* â€” What will this choice cost, and are we paying it **on purpose**? When life intrudes, the Retro migratesâ€”to a car, a green room, a rain-slicked walkâ€”same questions, new pressure. --- ## Themes & Motifs (Popular, not preachy) - **Love as discipline** â€” devotion that keeps its shape under heat - **The cost of control** â€” order as beauty *and* danger - **Faith as syntax** â€” prayers as breath, forgiveness as muscle memory - **Intimacy as architecture** â€” clauses, kitchens, night walks; the design language of staying --- ## Cold Open (Pilot) Black. Two sounds: a kettle mounting; a phone buzzâ€”once, twice, still. Light finds a small kitchen. Davidson stops the kettle before it screams. Two mugs, equal distance apart. He drafts a text. Deletes. The door opens. Mara slips inâ€”late, but within the agreed window. > **MARA** *(hanging her coat; a smile)* > Tell the truth before we get tired? > **DAVIDSON** > Itâ€™s written on our ledger. The scene is not about tea. --- ## Marketing Hooks - **Trope+Twist:** Contract romanceâ€¦ with healthy consent thatâ€™s actually thrilling. - **The Quote:** â€œ**Boundaries are the plot.**â€ - **Audience Bridges:** Fans of *Bridgerton*, *Normal People*, *Modern Love*, *From Scratch*, and anyone who wants adult romance with craft. --- ## Get Updates Opening chapter â€” coming soon.

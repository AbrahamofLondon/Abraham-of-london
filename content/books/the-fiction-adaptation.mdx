> *“He didn’t fall in love. He stood in it.”*

### Teaser

Eli Adeyemi can read systems, not people. After a decade of near-misses—a confidante who crosses the line, a polished benefactor whose generosity hides leverage, a rebel who mistakes adventure for intimacy, and a brief, bruising marriage—he’s left with ruins and a vow: **love will not make him smaller**.

Then comes **Mara Solace**—a producer with a spine and a calendar. Together they attempt a standards-driven romance: clear clauses, real faith, boundaries with teeth. *The Fiction Adaptation* is a fully fictional, high-stakes love story that moves from misfire to mastery, from collapse to craft. It’s intrigue and tenderness, risk and repair—proof that you can raise a life, a legacy, even an **empire**, without losing your soul.

### Logline

A disciplined London strategist must unlearn survival habits forged in past entanglements and a failed marriage to love a woman who matches his conviction—or lose the future he’s been building since boyhood.

### Themes & Setting

- **Devotion vs. desire** — heat with boundaries  
- **Standards under pressure** — ethics vs. loneliness, money, status  
- **Faith, quietly lived** — grammar, not genre  
- **Setting:** contemporary London with international edges  
- **Tone:** intimate, luminous, cinematic

> *“He didn’t fall in love. He stood in it.”*

### Teaser

Eli Adeyemi can read systems, not people. He measures everything—risk, time, silence—until love starts asking for what spreadsheets can’t hold. After a decade of near-misses and one brief, bruising marriage, he makes a vow: **love will not make him smaller**.

Then comes **Mara Solace**—a London producer with a spine, a calendar, and a faith she practices like craft. Together they attempt a standards-driven romance: clear clauses, clean exits, and boundaries with teeth. But the world doesn’t reward order. Old habits compete with new honesty; desire collides with discipline; and the city keeps raising the stakes.  

*The Fiction Adaptation* is a fully fictional, high-stakes love story that moves from misfire to mastery—intimate, modern, and built for the screen.

### Season One Arc

1. **Pilot — “Clauses”**  
   Eli and Mara draft a “working romance”: weekly retros, hard stop times, no ghosting. It works—until it doesn’t.

2. **“Friction”**  
   Work intrudes, old reflexes resurface. Eli trades disclosure for efficiency; Mara won’t produce a man who won’t show up.

3. **“Heat”**  
   Chemistry spikes. They negotiate intimacy like adults—clean, mutual, explicit consent—then learn tenderness isn’t a project plan.

4. **“Static”**  
   An opportunity abroad tempts Eli’s vanish-and-build instinct. Boundaries hold; trust wobbles.

5. **“Mirror”**  
   A past entanglement returns as a test case. They practice repair instead of performance.

6. **“Witness”**  
   Family dinner. Faith shows up quietly at the table: grace as habit, not spectacle.

7. **“Fault Line”**  
   A public misread threatens Mara’s work; Eli’s instinct is to fix, not feel. Distance opens.

8. **Finale — “Standards”**  
   They write a new contract: devotion that scales—time, truth, and staying. Not perfect. **Decided.**

### Themes & Motifs

- **Devotion vs. desire** — heat with boundaries  
- **Standards under pressure** — ethics vs. status, speed, and loneliness  
- **Faith, quietly lived** — prayer as practice, not plot device  
- **Love as craft** — retros, rituals, and repair

### Why Now

We’ve told a thousand stories about falling. This is about **staying**—and what it costs in an age of options. The series treats adulthood as dramatic, ethics as cinematic, and romance as a serious art.

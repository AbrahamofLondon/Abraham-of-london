**Operational Truth**: A man without a Rule is a man at the mercy of other men's agendas.
Chaos is the default state; order is the earned achievement of the [Sovereign](/lexicon/sovereignty).
</BriefAlert>

## I. Definition and Purpose

A **Rule** (Latin: *Regula* — a straight edge, a trellis) is a **personal governance system**: boundaries, rituals, and standards that stabilise identity and output.

Without a trellis, the vine doesn't “grow free.” It rots on the ground.

## II. The Three Jurisdictions of Governance

<ResponsibilityGrid>

<Responsibility icon="🕊️" title="The Altar (Internal)">
**Domain**: Soul, mind, conscience.
**Protocol**: **The First Hour.** Silence, Scripture, prayer, and decisive clarity.
</Responsibility>

<Responsibility icon="🏰" title="The Wall (Physical)">
**Domain**: Body, environment, household order.
**Protocol**: Tactical exertion **3× weekly**, controlled nutrition.
</Responsibility>

<Responsibility icon="⚒️" title="The Forge (Vocational)">
**Domain**: Mission, craft, calling.
**Protocol**: Deep Work blocks, ruthless distraction elimination.
</Responsibility>

</ResponsibilityGrid>

## III. Summary

Discipline is the price of freedom. If you do not govern yourself, you will be governed by men who are less capable and more cruel.

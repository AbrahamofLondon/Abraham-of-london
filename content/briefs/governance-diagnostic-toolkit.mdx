# Governance Diagnostic Toolkit

{"Governance is the art of maintaining order under pressure. When systems fail, it is rarely a failure of 'effort'; it is almost always a failure of 'boundary.'"}

## I. The Three-Point Diagnostic

Use this framework to evaluate your current "Jurisdiction of Responsibility."

<ResponsibilityGrid>

<Responsibility icon="🔍" title="Visibility Audit">
**Question**: Is the reality of the situation documented, or is it merely discussed?
**Red Flag**: Decisions made in chat apps without a central record.
</Responsibility>

<Responsibility icon="⚖️" title="Authority Audit">
**Question**: Does the person responsible for the outcome have the power to change the process?
**Red Flag**: Responsibility without Decision Rights.
</Responsibility>

<Responsibility icon="🛡️" title="Enforcement Audit">
**Question**: What happens when a standard is missed?
**Red Flag**: Standards that exist only as "suggestions" with no consequence for drift.
</Responsibility>

</ResponsibilityGrid>



## II. The Institutional Debt Scorecard

Rate each category from 1 (Chaos) to 10 (Sovereignty).

1.  **Communication**: Are decisions dated and stored in a "Single Source of Truth"?
2.  **Cadence**: Does the team/household meet on a predictable, high-leverage rhythm?
3.  **Financials**: Is there a clear "Runway" and "Debt Burn-down" plan?
4.  **Security**: Are keys, secrets, and boundaries rotated and audited quarterly?

  {"If you cannot measure the drift, you cannot manage the restoration. Always start with the data, not the 'vibes.'"}

# Institutional [Integrity](/lexicon/integrity) Audit

{"Integrity is not a moral feeling; it is structural wholeness. An institution has integrity when its inner workings match its outer claims."}

## I. The Audit Pillars

### 1. Document Integrity
* **The Constitution**: Is there a written document defining the "Why" and the "How"?
* **The Lexicon**: Does the organization use a shared language for complex concepts?
* **The Archive**: Is institutional memory preserved for the next generation of leaders?

### 2. Operational Integrity
* **The Definition of Done**: Is there a clear standard for "finished" work?
* **The Feedback Loop**: Are post-mortems conducted without blame to prevent repeat failures?
* **The Zero-Trust Layer**: Are security and access handled via "Least Privilege" protocols?

## II. Strategic Recommendation

If the Audit reveals a score below 70%, **Freeze Growth.**
  Scaling a broken system only scales the chaos. Fix the foundation before adding weight.

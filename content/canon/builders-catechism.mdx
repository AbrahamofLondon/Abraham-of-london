## FINAL DECLARATION

The Builder does not drift.
He aligns.

He does not complain of darkness.
He orders his house.

He does not seek applause.
He seeks endurance.

He remembers before he innovates.
He governs himself before he governs others.
He builds not for the hour, but for inheritance.

Let him stand.
Let him labour.
Let him transmit.

# **The Builder’s Catechism**
## *A Systematic Q&A for Builders, Fathers & Reformers*

This is not inspiration.
This is **instruction**.

This Catechism exists to clarify thought, harden resolve,
and align the builder with order, purpose, and destiny.

Read it slowly.
Return to it often.
Live by it deliberately.

# **Canon Master Index & Glossary (Preview)**  
### *Structural Language for Builders, Leaders & Civilisation-Carriers*

The Canon operates as a civilisational operating system.  
Every operating system needs a precise vocabulary and a clear index.

This page is a **controlled preview**, not the full reference.

- A **sample glossary** of core Canon terms (4 out of 40+)  
- A **sample index slice** (A–H only, heavily abridged)  
- A **reference architecture** signal for future cross-volume navigation  

<Callout type="warning">
<strong>Access Level: Preview.</strong>  
This page is intentionally limited. The full Glossary, Index and Code Appendix remain gated in the Master Canon editions and closed teaching environments.

## **1. Canon Glossary — Sample Terms**

<Callout type="note">
The full Canon Glossary currently contains 40+ core terms, plus sub-entries.  
Below is a small subset to give builders a feel for the language and structure.
</Callout>

<GlossaryTerm term="Dominion Mandate" code="G-23">
Humanity’s God-given responsibility to govern creation with righteousness, restraint, and reference to God’s character.
</GlossaryTerm>

<GlossaryTerm term="Governance" code="G-25">
The stewardship of order across spheres—personal, familial, institutional, civic and spiritual.
</GlossaryTerm>

<GlossaryTerm term="Tradition" code="G-37">
Wisdom preserved in time, protecting a people from the arrogance and amnesia of the present moment.
</GlossaryTerm>

<GlossaryTerm term="Wisdom" code="G-40">
Discernment in action—the ability to apply truth to complexity, timing and power without losing integrity.
</GlossaryTerm>

## **2. Multi-Volume Index System — A–Z (Sample Slice)**

A unified **A–Z Master Index** will span all ten volumes.

Each entry will include:

- **Term**  
- **Volume References** (Roman numerals)  
- **Model / Framework Codes** (where applicable)  
- **Key Subtopics**  

<Callout type="success">
Below is a shortened slice (A–H) to demonstrate the structure.  
The live Canon index will exceed 300 entries.
</Callout>

### **A**

**Alignment** — Vol. I, II, X; see **AI-02**  
*Subtopics:* purpose alignment, emotional alignment, institutional alignment

---

### **B**

**Builder (The)** — Vol. I, X  
*Subtopics:* identity of the builder, the builder’s pledge

---

### **C**

**Civilisation** — Vol. IV, IX, X  
*Subtopics:* rise, decay, renewal, destiny

---

### **F**

**Family** — Vol. III, IV  
*Subtopics:* structure, governance, fatherhood

---

### **H**

**History (Pattern Theory)** — Vol. IX  
*Subtopics:* cycles, repetition, memory

<Callout type="note">
The working A–Z index spans hundreds of entries. What you see here is deliberately narrow—a design preview, not a data dump.

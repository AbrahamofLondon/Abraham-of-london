# **Canon Master Index & Glossary (Preview)**  
### *Structural Language for Builders, Leaders & Civilisation-Carriers*

The Canon operates as a civilisational operating system.  
Every operating system needs a precise vocabulary and a clear index.

This is a **preview** of that system.

- A **Glossary** of core Canon terms (extended set: 21–40)  
- A **Multi-Volume Index** template (A–H excerpt)  
- A **Reference Architecture** for future cross-volume navigation  

<Callout type="info">
The full printed Canon will include a 200+ page combined Glossary, Index, and Reference Code appendix.  
This page is an early signal for builders and serious readers.

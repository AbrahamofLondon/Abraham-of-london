# **CANONICAL GOVERNANCE NOTE**

All frameworks, diagrams, matrices, and toolkits contained in this volume
operate under the doctrinal authority of **The Builder's Catechism (Appendix A)**.

The Catechism functions as:
- interpretive rule
- moral constraint
- alignment standard

Deviation produces drift.
Alignment produces continuity.






# **APPENDIX B**
## **FRAMEWORK DEPLOYMENT RULES**

1. [Purpose](/lexicon/purpose) precedes power
2. Alignment before scale
3. [Family](/lexicon/family) is non-negotiable
4. Power must be restrained
5. No tool is neutral
6. Generational impact is mandatory






# **APPENDIX D**
## **CANON GOVERNANCE CHARTER**

- Authority rests with the Author
- Doctrine is not crowdsourced
- Adaptation is permitted; distortion is not
- Stewardship carries moral responsibility






**END OF VOLUME X**
*The Canon is complete.*

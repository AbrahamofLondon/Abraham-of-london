      ## The 5 Standards That Endure

      **1. Sovereignty**
    <blockquote>
     Own your outcomes. Blame is weakness. The fight is won or lost in your internal
    </blockquote>

      **2. Discipline**

> Master your time, your space, and your word. Chaos is costly. Non-negotiable daily rhythm.

      **3. Truth**

> Speak plainly. Do not lie, excuse, or equivocate. Truth with tenderness is the only form of courage.

      **4. Presence**

> Be here now. Listen with your eyes, not just your ears. If you must be present, be present *on purpose*.

      **5. Legacy**

> Build what lasts. The measure of a man is his son's character, not his quarterly results.

      <Rule />

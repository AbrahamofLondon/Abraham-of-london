## Introduction

This covenant is for men who are **serious about brotherhood** – not in theory, but in practice.

It is not a legal document. It is a **voluntary commitment** to:

- Walk in truth
- Protect each other’s destiny
- Refuse the culture of isolation, secret sin and silent collapse

You can read this together, sign it, and review it annually.

## Our Shared Vision

> _“We are brothers by choice. We will not watch each other fall in silence. We will tell the truth, fight for each other’s future, and honour God in how we walk together.”_

---

## 1. Commitment to Truth

We agree:

1. To speak **truth in love**, even when it is uncomfortable.
2. To reject flattery, gossip and half-truths about each other.
3. To share honestly about our pressures – financial, relational, emotional, spiritual – at an agreed rhythm.

> _“No performance. No pretending. No man left to drown quietly.”_

---

## 2. Commitment to Confidentiality

We agree:

1. What is shared in this circle stays in this circle, unless:

   - Someone is in danger, or
   - The brother gives clear permission to share.

2. We will protect each other’s reputation in public, even when we are frustrated in private.

3. If conflict arises, we will address it **directly and privately first**, not through third parties.

---

## 3. Commitment to Responsibility

We agree:

1. To **ask hard questions** when we see drift – in faith, family, finances, or character.
2. To challenge each other’s decisions where we see clear risk or self-deception.
3. To show up – not only in crisis, but in the **ordinary rhythms of life**:
   - birthdays, milestones, transitions, setbacks.

We are not saviours. But we are **responsible brothers**.

---

## 4. Commitment to Honour

We agree:

1. To honour each other’s time, families, and boundaries.
2. To celebrate wins – promotions, breakthroughs, answered prayers – not with envy but with joy.
3. To carry each other’s burdens in prayer and practical support where possible.

Honour means we **remember who the other man is in God’s eyes**, even when he has forgotten.

---

## 5. Practical Rhythm

We agree on:

- **Primary rhythm:**
  - Example: 1x monthly in-person / online meeting (60–90 minutes).
- **Secondary touchpoints:**
  - Example: weekly check-in message (voice note / short call).

We appoint a simple **rotation**:

- One brother coordinates the monthly slot.
- Another tracks key commitments/decisions.

Nothing fancy. Just deliberate.

## 6. Covenant Statement

> _“By God’s grace, I choose to walk in brotherhood with these men. I commit to truth, confidentiality, responsibility and honour as outlined above. I understand this covenant is voluntary, but I take my word seriously. When I fail, I will own it and repair it. When my brother fails, I will confront him in love, not abandon him in shame.”_

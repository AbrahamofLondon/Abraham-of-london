## The Code: Presence & Integrity

1. **Show up.** Weekly touchpoints. No ghosts.
2. **Tell the truth.** Confess struggles before collapse.
3. **Carry weight.** Pray, call, turn up at the door.
4. **Protect families.** No gossip; cover, don't expose.
5. **Build together.** Study, train, serve. Produce—not just post.

<Note tone="caution" title="Red Flags (address quickly)">
* Chronic lateness without accountability
* Secret-keeping, triangulation, spiritual one-upmanship
</Note>

## Weekly Rhythm (60—90 min)
* **Scripture (45)** — read & discuss
* **Formation (30)** — habits, money, marriage, parenting
* **Intercession (15)** — names, needs, next steps

<Verse cite="Ecclesiastes 4:9—10">
  "Two are better than one… If either falls, one helps the other up."
</Verse>

## Covenant Statement
We commit for 90 days to weekly presence, truth-telling, confidentiality, practical service, and family protection. We will correct in love, receive correction with humility, and escalate conflict quickly for peace.

## Introduction

This covenant is for men who are **serious about brotherhood** - not in theory, but in practice.

It is not a legal document. It is a **voluntary commitment** to:

- Walk in truth
- Protect each other's destiny
- Refuse the culture of isolation, secret sin and silent collapse

You can read this together, sign it, and review it annually.

## 1. Commitment to Truth

We agree:

1. To speak **truth in love**, even when it is uncomfortable.
2. To reject flattery, gossip and half-truths about each other.
3. To share honestly about our pressures - financial, relational, emotional, spiritual - at an agreed rhythm.

&gt; _"No performance. No pretending. No man left to drown quietly."_

## 3. Commitment to [Responsibility](/lexicon/responsibility)

We agree:

1. To **ask hard questions** when we see drift - in faith, family, finances, or character.
2. To challenge each other's decisions where we see clear risk or self-deception.
3. To show up - not only in crisis, but in the **ordinary rhythms of life**:
   - birthdays, milestones, transitions, setbacks.

We are not saviours. But we are **responsible brothers**.

## 5. Practical Rhythm

We agree on:

- **Primary rhythm:**
  - Example: 1x monthly in-person / online meeting (60-90 minutes).
- **Secondary touchpoints:**
  - Example: weekly check-in message (voice note / short call).

We appoint a simple **rotation**:

- One brother coordinates the monthly slot.
- Another tracks key commitments/decisions.

Nothing fancy. Just deliberate.

Review this covenant every 6-12 months and ask honestly:
**"Are we still walking what we said?"**

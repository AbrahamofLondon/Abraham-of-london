# Canon Volume IV - Culture-Decadence Diagnostic Toolkit

### Strategic assessments for leaders, architects and reformers.

This toolkit operationalises the principles in **Canon Volume IV** and equips you to **measure**, **map**, and **intervene** in cultural systems.

<Callout type="info">
**Use this toolkit to diagnose:** families, organisations, churches, political parties, communities or entire nations.
</Callout>

## 1. The Rise-Decay Civilisational Index

This is the Canon's **primary diagnostic**, rating a society across 10 cultural indicators.

### The Ten Indicators

Score each from **1 (critical decay)** to **10 (civilisational rise)**:

1. **Moral Vision** - clarity of right/wrong in public life
2. **Fatherhood & Generational Continuity**
3. **Shared Cultural Honour**
4. **Institutional Discipline**
5. **Truth Commitment**
6. **Economic Productivity**
7. **Boundary Strength** (moral + cultural)
8. **Cultural Memory & [Identity](/lexicon/identity)**
9. **Heroic [Leadership](/lexicon/leadership)**
10. **Community Trust & Cohesion**

### Interpretation

* **80-100** &rarr; Civilisational ascent
* **60-79** &rarr; Stable but vulnerable
* **40-59** &rarr; Drift and soft decay
* **20-39** &rarr; Advanced decadence
* **00-19** &rarr; Pre-collapse or collapse



<Callout type="warning">
If the indicators "Fatherhood," "Truth," or "Cultural Memory" fall below 4, the entire civilisational structure becomes unstable.
</Callout>

## 2. The Drift Spectrum

A rapid assessment tool to detect early cultural drift across five domains:

### Domains

* **[Purpose](/lexicon/purpose) Drift**
* **Moral Drift**
* **Institutional Drift**
* **[Identity](/lexicon/identity) Drift**
* **[Leadership](/lexicon/leadership) Drift**

Score each domain from **A to E**:

* **A - Stable** (anchored and aligned)
* **B - Mild drift**
* **C - Noticeable misalignment**
* **D - Advanced drift**
* **E - Collapse trajectory**

### Intervention Threshold

{"If two or more domains score D or E, drift has become systemic."}

{"\"Drift is rarely dramatic. It is silent, cumulative, and ultimately devastating.\""}

## 3. Cultural Softness Scale (CSS-12)

A 12-item behavioural test for identifying softness-driven decay. Rate each on a 1-5 scale:

1. Decline in sacrifice
2. Avoidance of responsibility
3. Consumerism over contribution
4. Emotional fragility
5. Entitlement
6. Instant gratification norms
7. Loss of work ethic
8. Low resilience to discomfort
9. Dependency
10. Admiration of indulgence
11. Weakening of discipline
12. Decline in honour and duty

### Scoring

* **12-24** &rarr; Strong culture
* **25-40** &rarr; Softening
* **41-60** &rarr; Advanced softness
* **61+** &rarr; Cultural fragility / collapse precursor

## 4. The Moral Imagination Audit

1. What stories shape our desires?
2. What heroes do we celebrate?
3. What is considered admirable?
4. What is considered shameful?
5. What do our youth aspire to become?

## 5. Canon Renewal Blueprint Generator

Leaders assemble an actionable Renewal Blueprint across five layers:

* **Layer 1 - Truth Reset**: Rebuild authority around reality.
* **Layer 2 - Boundary Reconstruction**: Repair broken moral and institutional boundaries.
* **Layer 3 - Formation Communities**: Define the rhythms that shape the people.
* **Layer 4 - Rhythms & Rituals**: Reconstruct stabilising spiritual + cultural rhythms.
* **Layer 5 - Institutional Repair**: Restore moral authority and longevity architecture.

# **Canon Volume V - Governance Diagnostic Toolkit**

### _The architecture of order made operational._

Governance is not the bureaucracy of power.  
Governance is the **stewardship of order** - personal, institutional, national.

This toolkit equips leaders to **audit**, **correct**, and **fortify** governance systems across every level.

<Callout type="info">
  Use these diagnostics for boards, ministries, families, organisations,
  churches, nation-building entities and personal leadership development.
</Callout>

# **1. Authority Health Index (AHI)**

### _Measure the strength, legitimacy, and moral clarity of authority._

Rate each item from 1-10:

1. **Legitimacy** - Is authority morally grounded?
2. **Competence** - Can decisions be trusted?
3. **Courage** - Does leadership act decisively?
4. **Accountability** - Boundaries around power
5. **Moral Authority** - Ability to command honour
6. **Clarity of Role** - Absence of ambiguity
7. **Boundary Enforcement**
8. **Trust from Below**
9. **Respect from Above**
10. **Integration with Truth & Reality**

### **Interpretation**

- **85-100** → High-authority ecosystem
- **60-84** → Stable but vulnerable
- **40-59** → Weak authority; prone to drift
- **20-39** → Crisis of governance
- **00-19** → Collapse of authority

<Callout type="warning">
  Authority does not disappear. If legitimate authority collapses, illegitimate
  authority fills the vacuum.
</Callout>

<Divider />

# **2. Governance Order Scale (GOS-5)**

### _Assess how structured, disciplined, and aligned a system is._

Score **1-5** for each domain:

1. **Strategic Order** - Clarity, alignment, purpose
2. **Structural Order** - Roles, hierarchy, boundaries
3. **Moral Order** - Truth, ethics, discipline
4. **Operational Order** - Work rhythms, procedures
5. **Cultural Order** - Honour, unity, tradition

### **Scoring Bands**

- **5-12** → Disorder
- **13-18** → Managed chaos
- **19-22** → Functional order
- **23-25** → High-order governance

<Quote>Order is the atmosphere in which truth becomes effective.</Quote>

<Divider />

# **3. Stewardship Competency Map (SCM)**

### _A high-level governance skill map for leaders._

Rate from **1-7** (1 = undeveloped, 7 = elite):

- Vision Stewardship
- People Stewardship
- Resource Stewardship
- Institutional Stewardship
- Moral Stewardship
- Boundary Stewardship
- Time & Legacy Stewardship

Interpretation:

- **7 = Canon-level excellence**
- **5-6 = Strong governance capacity**
- **3-4 = Requires development**
- **1-2 = Governance risk**

<Callout type="success">
  Stewardship is not about ownership. It is accountability to a future
  generation.
</Callout>

<Divider />

# **4. Institutional Drift Detector (IDD)**

### _Find where systems are drifting before collapse becomes visible._

Score each item **Low / Medium / High Risk**:

1. **Mission Drift**
2. **Boundary Drift**
3. **Cultural Drift**
4. **Moral Drift**
5. **Identity Drift**
6. **Leadership Drift**
7. **Responsibility Drift**

### **Red-Flag Conditions**

- High-risk in **2 or more** areas → institutional decay
- High-risk in **3 or more** → collapse trajectory

<Callout type="danger">
  Institutions do not collapse at the top. They collapse where truth is
  forgotten and boundaries soften.
</Callout>

<Divider />

# **5. Long-Horizon Leadership Audit (LHLA)**

### _A strategic audit of the leader's time, vision and legacy orientation._

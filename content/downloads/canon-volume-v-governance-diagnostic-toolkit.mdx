# Canon Volume V - [Governance](/lexicon/governance) Diagnostic Toolkit

[Governance](/lexicon/governance) is the **stewardship of order**—personal, institutional, national.

## 1. Authority Health Index (AHI)

**Rate each item from 1-10:**

1. **Legitimacy** - Is authority morally grounded?
2. **Competence** - Can decisions be trusted?
3. **Courage** - Does leadership act decisively?
4. **Accountability** - Boundaries around power
5. **Moral Authority** - Ability to command honor



### Interpretation

* **85-100** &rarr; High-authority ecosystem
* **60-84** &rarr; Stable but vulnerable
* **40-59** &rarr; Weak authority; prone to drift
* **&lt;40** &rarr; Crisis of governance

## 2. [Governance](/lexicon/governance) Order Scale (GOS-5)

**Score 1-5 for each domain:**

1. **Strategic Order** - Clarity, alignment, purpose
2. **Structural Order** - Roles, hierarchy, boundaries
3. **Moral Order** - Truth, ethics, discipline
4. **Operational Order** - Work rhythms, procedures
5. **Cultural Order** - Honor, unity, tradition

### Scoring Bands

* **5-12** &rarr; Disorder
* **13-18** &rarr; Managed chaos
* **19-22** &rarr; Functional order
* **23-25** &rarr; High-order governance

## 3. Institutional Drift Detector (IDD)

**Score each item Low / Medium / High Risk:**

* Mission Drift
* Boundary Drift
* Cultural Drift
* Moral Drift

<Callout type="danger">
Institutions do not collapse at the top. They collapse where truth is forgotten and boundaries soften.
</Callout>

## 4. Long-Horizon [Leadership](/lexicon/leadership) Audit (LHLA)

### Scores

* **85-100** &rarr; Legacy Architect
* **70-84** &rarr; System Builder
* **50-69** &rarr; Operational Leader
* **&lt;50** &rarr; Rebuild governance foundations

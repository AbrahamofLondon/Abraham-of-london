## Purpose

This script gives brothers a **clear, repeatable structure** for honest conversations - especially when things are busy, messy, or tense.  
It is not a performance. It is simply a **framework to protect truth, honour and brotherhood**.

You can use it:

- For weekly or monthly check-ins
- Before or after a major decision
- When there has been tension, distance or silence

## Step 2 - Reality Check (5-10 minutes each)

**Goal:** say clearly where you really are - no spin, no pretending.

Use this simple template:

1. **State your headline:**

   - _"Headline: I feel stretched and close to burnout."_
   - _"Headline: I am excited about this new opportunity but unsure if it's wise."_

2. **Name your top 3 realities:**

   - _"Financially..."_
   - _"Emotionally..."_
   - _"Spiritually..."_

3. **Identify any pressure points:**
   - _"The biggest pressure right now is..."_
   - _"What keeps me awake at night is..."_

No one interrupts. No fixing yet. Just listening to understand.

## Step 4 - Decisions & Commitments (5-10 minutes)

**Goal:** leave with clear next steps - not just good feelings.

Each brother answers:

- **1. What am I deciding?**

  - _"I will speak to my wife about this by Friday."_
  - _"I will say no to this deal, even though it looks lucrative."_

- **2. What will I do in the next 7 days?**

  - _"I will send you an update message by Wednesday evening."_

- **3. What support do I need from you?**
  - _"I need you to challenge me if I start to drift from this decision."_
  - _"Please ask me specifically about my thought life next week."_

Agree **one concrete follow-up date**.

## Step 6 - Follow-Up Rhythm

To keep this script alive:

- Use it **weekly for crisis seasons**, **monthly for normal seasons**.
- Keep a simple log: date, headline, decisions.
- Review: _"What have we kept? Where have we drifted? What needs repairing?"_

This is how brotherhood moves from **good intentions to disciplined loyalty**.

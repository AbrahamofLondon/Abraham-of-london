# Communication Script — BPF

**Brief** — the facts in two sentences.  
**Point** — what matters and why it broke standard.  
**Forward** — the decision, owner, and deadline.

### Usage
- Write it first, *then* say it.  
- Remove adjectives that add heat without light.  
- Finish with **Next Check-In** (date).

Includes printable sheets and examples for performance, risk, and board updates.

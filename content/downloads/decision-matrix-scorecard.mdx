# Decision Matrix Scorecard

A **fillable** matrix designed to reduce decision failure.

## Best used when:
- You have multiple options and competing values
- The decision has second-order consequences
- Stakeholders are persuasive but inconsistent
- You need an auditable rationale (board-grade hygiene)

## Output:
- Weighted scores
- Trade-offs made explicit
- A decision narrative you can defend later

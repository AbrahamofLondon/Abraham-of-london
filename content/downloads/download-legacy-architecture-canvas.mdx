# The [Legacy](/lexicon/legacy) Architecture Canvas

**Beyond bequest. The framework for intentional endurance.**

<Callout type="success">
  This canvas converts legacy from abstraction into an executable design system.
</Callout>

## Core Philosophy

[Legacy](/lexicon/legacy) is not what you leave behind — it is what you build forward.

## Implementation Guidance

Start small. Think deep.

Begin with the Sovereign Thesis alone. Sit with it for one week.
The clarity — or friction — it generates will reveal the necessity of everything that follows.

> Legacy is not a destination — it is a direction.  
> The canvas provides the map. You still have to walk like a steward.

&lt;Callout tone="key" title="The Entrepreneur's Core Discipline"&gt;
  The true test of a founder is not in the launch, but in the discipline of the
  weekly rhythm. This pack provides the minimum viable operating system for
  founders who prioritize sanity and long-term endurance over chaotic speed.
&lt;/Callout&gt;

## I. The Weekly Operating Rhythm (WOR)

Every week must begin with clarity and end with accountability. Use the Weekly Operating Rhythm (WOR) to enforce structure and prevent decision fatigue.

### Daily Blocks

- **Deep Work:** 3 hours maximum of focused, high-leverage activity.
- **Interface:** 2 hours maximum for calls, meetings, and emails.
- **Review:** 30 minutes minimum for self-audit and planning the next day.

### Weekly Flow

1.  **Monday (Plan):** Set the top 3 objectives (O3). Clear the inbox.
2.  **Wednesday (Triage):** Mid-week pulse check. Address the top operational risk.
3.  **Friday (Accountability):** Review O3 progress. Financial pulse check (Cash/Forecast).

&lt;Rule /&gt;

## II. The Financial Triage Checklist

In times of uncertainty, clarity on cash is non-negotiable. This list is a survival checklist for cash-conservation mode.

&lt;ol&gt;
  * **Cash Runway:** How many days until $0? (Must be visible daily).
  * **Customer Value:** Which 20% of customers drive 80% of revenue? Call them.
  * **Burn Rate:** Which 3 expenses can be eliminated today?
  * **Covenant Check:** Are we compliant with bank/board agreements?
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;Rule /&gt;

## III. 30-60-90 Day Planning

Use this framework to align your team and board on immediate, measurable goals.

&lt;Callout tone="info" title="The Three Horizons"&gt;
  * **30 Days (Triage):** Immediate cash and operational stability. What must
  not fail? * **60 Days (Stabilization):** Process hardening and resource
  alignment. What 3 systems need to be implemented? * **90 Days (Horizon):** The
  market opportunity and key partnerships. What is the single biggest win we can
  capture?
&lt;/Callout&gt;

&lt;Rule /&gt;

<Callout tone="key" title="The Entrepreneur's Core Discipline">
  The true test of a founder is not in the launch, but in the discipline of the weekly rhythm. This pack provides the minimum viable operating system for founders who prioritize sanity and long-term endurance over chaotic speed.
</Callout>

## I. The Weekly Operating Rhythm (WOR)

Every week must begin with clarity and end with accountability. Use the Weekly Operating Rhythm (WOR) to enforce structure and prevent decision fatigue.

### Daily Blocks
* **Deep Work:** 3 hours maximum of focused, high-leverage activity.
* **Interface:** 2 hours maximum for calls, meetings, and emails.
* **Review:** 30 minutes minimum for self-audit and planning the next day.

### Weekly Flow
1.  **Monday (Plan):** Set the top 3 objectives (O3). Clear the inbox.
2.  **Wednesday (Triage):** Mid-week pulse check. Address the top operational risk.
3.  **Friday (Accountability):** Review O3 progress. Financial pulse check (Cash/Forecast).

## II. The Financial Triage Checklist

In times of uncertainty, clarity on cash is non-negotiable. This list is a survival checklist for cash-conservation mode.

<ol>
  <li>**Cash Runway:** How many days until $0? (Must be visible daily).</li>
  <li>**Customer Value:** Which 20% of customers drive 80% of revenue? Call them.</li>
  <li>**Burn Rate:** Which 3 expenses can be eliminated today?</li>
  <li>**Covenant Check:** Are we compliant with bank/board agreements?</li>
</ol>

<Rule />

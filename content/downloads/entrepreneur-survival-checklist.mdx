## Why a Survival Checklist?

In theory, entrepreneurship is innovation, disruption and upside.
In reality, it is often **cashflow stress, uncertainty and invisible pressure**.

This checklist is designed to help you **survive long enough to win** - without losing your integrity, your family or your mind.

## 2. Revenue Pipeline

- [ ] I can list my **top 10 current opportunities** and their likely close dates.
- [ ] I know **who** needs a call, follow-up or proposal this week.
- [ ] I am not building a product in isolation from real, paying customers.
- [ ] At least one block of my week is protected for **selling / business development**, not just admin.

Question to ask yourself weekly:

&gt; _"If nothing new closed for 90 days, what would actually happen?"_

## 4. Legal & Compliance Basics

- [ ] My company registrations, filings and tax obligations are not being ignored.
- [ ] I know my next **critical filing date** (e.g. accounts, tax return).
- [ ] I have at least a **basic written agreement** with key customers and partners.

Chaos and confusion are expensive. [Clarity](/lexicon/clarity) is cheaper than litigation.

## 6. Decision Framework

Before major decisions (new hire, big spend, pivot), ask:

- [ ] What problem am I actually solving?
- [ ] What are my **best-case, base-case, worst-case** scenarios?
- [ ] What is the **irreversible downside** if this goes wrong?
- [ ] Who have I let challenge this decision?

If you cannot explain the decision on **one page**, you probably do not understand it yet.

## 7. Red / Amber / Green Self-Assessment

Take 5 minutes and label each area:

- **Green:** under control, monitored
- **Amber:** gaps, but manageable
- **Red:** serious risk, needs immediate attention

Then choose **one red and one amber** to tackle this week. Survival is not magic; it is **consistent, honest prioritisation**.

## Why a Survival Checklist?

In theory, entrepreneurship is innovation, disruption and upside.  
In reality, it is often **cashflow stress, uncertainty and invisible pressure**.

This checklist is designed to help you **survive long enough to win** - without losing your integrity, your family or your mind.

## 1. Cash & Runway

- [ ] I know **exactly** how much cash is in the business today.
- [ ] I know my **monthly burn** (all-in).
- [ ] I know my **runway in months** at current burn.
- [ ] I have a **simple weekly cash dashboard** (even if it's a spreadsheet).

If you cannot answer these in one minute, that is your first action item.

---

## 2. Revenue Pipeline

- [ ] I can list my **top 10 current opportunities** and their likely close dates.
- [ ] I know **who** needs a call, follow-up or proposal this week.
- [ ] I am not building a product in isolation from real, paying customers.
- [ ] At least one block of my week is protected for **selling / business development**, not just admin.

Question to ask yourself weekly:

> _"If nothing new closed for 90 days, what would actually happen?"_

---

## 3. Cost Discipline

- [ ] I have reviewed all subscriptions, tools and software in the last 90 days.
- [ ] I am not carrying "vanity costs" to impress people who are not paying the bills.
- [ ] I know which costs I would cut **first, second and third** if revenue dipped by 30%.

Survival is a discipline: **cut ego, not essentials.**

---

## 4. Legal & Compliance Basics

- [ ] My company registrations, filings and tax obligations are not being ignored.
- [ ] I know my next **critical filing date** (e.g. accounts, tax return).
- [ ] I have at least a **basic written agreement** with key customers and partners.

Chaos and confusion are expensive. Clarity is cheaper than litigation.

---

## 5. Personal Resilience

- [ ] I have at least **one person** I can tell the whole truth about the business.
- [ ] I have a **weekly rest rhythm** (even a half-day) where I step away to think and breathe.
- [ ] I am not secretly funding the business in a way that is destroying my family or future.
- [ ] I have a simple plan for **sleep, exercise and prayer/reflection**.

Entrepreneurial burnout is usually not sudden. It is **accumulated neglect**.

---

## 6. Decision Framework

Before major decisions (new hire, big spend, pivot), ask:

- [ ] What problem am I actually solving?
- [ ] What are my **best-case, base-case, worst-case** scenarios?
- [ ] What is the **irreversible downside** if this goes wrong?
- [ ] Who have I let challenge this decision?

If you cannot explain the decision on **one page**, you probably do not understand it yet.

## 7. Red / Amber / Green Self-Assessment

Take 5 minutes and label each area:

- **Green:** under control, monitored
- **Amber:** gaps, but manageable
- **Red:** serious risk, needs immediate attention

Then choose **one red and one amber** to tackle this week. Survival is not magic; it is **consistent, honest prioritisation**.

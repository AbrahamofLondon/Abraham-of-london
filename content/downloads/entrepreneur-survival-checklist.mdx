# Entrepreneur Survival Checklist — When the Week Turns

<PullLine subtle>When the storm hits, focus on the three C's: Cash, Customers, Covenants. Everything else is secondary.</PullLine>

## Triage
1. **Cash today / this month / next month**. 
2. **Customers** — who must not churn; call them. 
3. **Covenants** — bank, board, suppliers: align the story.

<Rule />

## Stabilise
- Freeze non-essential spend. 
- One truth page for team + board. 
- Daily 15-minute stand-to: risks, owners, decisions.

<Rule />

## Exit the Storm
- Retrospective: what mechanism failed? 
- Add the missing guardrail to the playbook.

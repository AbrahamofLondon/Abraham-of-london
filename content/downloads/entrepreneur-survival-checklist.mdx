# Entrepreneur Survival Checklist — When the Week Turns

## Triage
1. **Cash today / this month / next month**.  
2. **Customers** — who must not churn; call them.  
3. **Covenants** — bank, board, suppliers: align the story.

## Stabilise
- Freeze non-essential spend.  
- One truth page for team + board.  
- Daily 15-minute stand-to: risks, owners, decisions.

## Exit the Storm
- Retrospective: what mechanism failed?  
- Add the missing guardrail to the playbook.

Printable checklist included.

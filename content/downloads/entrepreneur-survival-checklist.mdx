<PullLine subtle>When the storm hits, focus on the three C's: Cash, Customers, Covenants. Everything else is secondary.</PullLine>

## Triage
1. **Cash today / this month / next month**.
2. **Customers** — who must not churn; call them.
3. **Covenants** — bank, board, suppliers: align the story.

<Rule />

## Stabilise
* Freeze non-essential spend.
* One truth page for team + board.
* Daily 15-minute stand-to: risks, owners, decisions.

<Rule />

## Exit the Storm
* Retrospective: what mechanism failed?
* Add the missing guardrail to the playbook.

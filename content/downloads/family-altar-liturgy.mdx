## Why a [Family](/lexicon/family) Altar?

Every home is built on something: noise, hurry, screens - or **intentional presence**.

A family altar is not a piece of furniture. It is a **pattern of meeting God together** - simple, repeatable, and rooted in Scripture.

This liturgy is designed to work in:

- Busy weekday evenings
- Early mornings before school
- Weekly "[Family](/lexicon/family) Night" slots

Aim for **15-20 minutes**. Consistency is more important than perfection.

## 1. Call to Attention

The leader (usually a parent) simply says:

&gt; _"Let's come to the table. Phones down, TV off. This is our time before God as a family."_

Then a short call:

&gt; **Leader:** "The Lord is our Shepherd."
&gt; **[Family](/lexicon/family):** "We will not fear."

You can choose any simple verse to repeat every time. Repetition builds memory.

## 3. Conversation & Reflection

Ask **simple, open questions**:

- _"What stood out to you?"_
- _"What does this tell us about God?"_
- _"What does this invite us to do or change?"_

Do not turn it into an exam. The aim is **heart engagement**, not perfect theology.

For younger children:

- _"Where do you see God being kind in this story?"_
- _"How can we show that same kindness this week?"_

You can end with one clear takeaway:

&gt; _"Tonight's truth: God is our shepherd. He sees us, leads us, and provides for us."_

Write it on a sticky note and leave it somewhere visible.

## Weekly Rhythm Example

**Monday:** Psalm focus (comfort and trust)
**Wednesday:** Gospel story (character of Jesus)
**Friday:** Thanksgiving night (what God has done this week)
**Sunday evening:** Look ahead (school, work, major events)

The goal is not to manufacture perfection. The goal is to **anchor your home in the presence and Word of God**.

Start small. Stay consistent. Let the atmosphere of your home shift over time.

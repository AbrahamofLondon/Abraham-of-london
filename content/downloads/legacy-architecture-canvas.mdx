# Legacy Architecture Canvas

## Transform Intentions into Institutions

The Legacy Architecture Canvas is an institutional-grade framework designed for sovereign individuals, families, and organizations seeking to transform fleeting intentions into enduring structures. This interactive tool provides the mental models, strategic frameworks, and practical tools needed to design, build, and protect multi-generational legacies.

## Why This Canvas is Different

Traditional planning tools focus on tactical execution or financial planning alone. The Legacy Architecture Canvas integrates seven critical dimensions of institutional design:

1. **Sovereign Thesis** – Your foundational worldview and purpose
2. **Capital Matrix** – Holistic capital allocation across all forms
3. **Institutional Design** – Legal and operational structures
4. **Guardrails** – Protection and governance mechanisms
5. **Knowledge Architecture** – Intellectual capital preservation
6. **Cultural Transmission** – Values and wisdom transfer
7. **Timeline Horizon** – Multi-generational planning

## How to Use This Canvas

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
1. Complete the Sovereign Thesis section with deep reflection
2. Map your current Capital Matrix honestly
3. Identify gaps between current state and desired legacy

### Phase 2: Design (Week 3-4)
1. Design your Institutional structures
2. Establish Guardrails and protection systems
3. Create your Knowledge Architecture plan

### Phase 3: Implementation (Month 2-3)
1. Begin with one small Institutional element
2. Establish quarterly review cadence
3. Document decisions and rationale

### Phase 4: Evolution (Ongoing)
1. Review and update annually
2. Expand Institutional complexity as needed
3. Train successors in framework use

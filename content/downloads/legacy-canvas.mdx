# The Legacy Architecture Canvas

**Beyond Bequest. The Framework for Intentional Endurance.**

<ProTip type="premium">
This is not a document about death. It is the operating system for a living legacy. Designed for founders, leaders, and stewards who view their life's work as capital—human, intellectual, social, and financial—to be engineered for multigenerational impact.
</ProTip>

## The Architecture Process

This structured framework transforms abstract values into executable design:

<FeatureGrid columns={2} items={[
  {
    title: "1. The Sovereign Thesis",
    content: "Define the core, non-negotiable principle of your legacy. What is the *why* that must survive all else?"
  },
  {
    title: "2. The Capital Matrix",
    content: "Map your key capitals: **Human** (character), **Intellectual** (philosophy), **Social** (networks), **Financial** (assets), and **Structural** (institutions)."
  },
  {
    title: "3. Institutions & Stewardship",
    content: "Design the formal/informal institutions (Family Council, Trust, Annual Retreat) that steward each capital."
  },
  {
    title: "4. Risk Architecture",
    content: "Identify failure modes—from dilution to dependency—and engineer specific safeguards and governance guardrails."
  }
]} />

## The Complete Framework

<LegacyDiagram />

### What This Produces

- **A Living Legacy Constitution** – Not a static document, but a dynamic operating system for your values
- **Intergenerational Governance Blueprint** – Clear roles, responsibilities, and decision-rights for stewards
- **Risk Mitigation Framework** – Proactive design against the 7 classic failure modes of legacy
- **Stewardship Rituals** – Quarterly and annual review cadences that institutionalize reflection and adaptation

<ProTip type="implementation">
**Implementation Note:** Begin with the Sovereign Thesis alone. Sit with it for one week. The clarity—or friction—it generates will illuminate the necessity of every subsequent component.
</ProTip>

## Companion Resources

This canvas integrates with our full **Legacy Architecture** suite:

- **The Steward's Brief** – Communication templates for family/trustee alignment
- **Guardrail Design Workshop** – Video walkthrough of risk mitigation strategies

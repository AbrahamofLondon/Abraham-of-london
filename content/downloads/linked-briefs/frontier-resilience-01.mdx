## I. Executive Summary

The transition from traditional emerging market frameworks toward "Frontier Resilience" requires a shift from efficiency-seeking to **anti-fragility**. In high-volatility environments, the primary risk is not market movement, but institutional dissolution.

## II. Strategic Framework

Our analysis suggests that the **Modular Governance Model** (MGM) outperforms centralized structures in three key metrics:
1. Operational Latency reduction by 14%.
2. Capital flight mitigation during liquidity events.
3. Local node autonomy during regional black-out periods.

### The Decoupling Principle

By decoupling the "Execution Layer" from the "Policy Layer," institutions can survive even when local regulatory environments undergo catastrophic shifts.

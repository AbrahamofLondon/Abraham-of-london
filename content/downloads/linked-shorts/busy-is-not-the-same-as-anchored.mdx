  You can be productive and still be drifting. Busyness hides drift. Purpose
  exposes it. Movement is not the same as direction.

Most people are not tired because life is hard.

They are tired because life is scattered.

You can be productive and still be drifting. You can be scheduled and still be unfocused. You can be praised and still be hollow.

Movement is not direction.

When your life is not anchored to a defined purpose, everything begins to compete for control — trends, emotions, other people’s expectations, temporary opportunities.

Without vision, you don’t just wander. You slowly surrender your steering.

Busyness can disguise drift for years.

But eventually, you will feel it.

The question is simple:

Are you advancing toward something — or just avoiding stillness?

Because stillness is where the audit happens.

Anchor your life.

Or it will anchor itself to whatever shouts the loudest.

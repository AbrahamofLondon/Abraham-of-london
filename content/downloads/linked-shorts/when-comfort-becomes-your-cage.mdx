Not all prisons have bars.
Some have subscriptions,
same-day delivery,
and a "skip intro" button.

You're not in crisis.
You're in **comfort**.

And that's the problem.


{/* stripped: duplicate frontmatter block */}


Here's the blunt line:

Your future is being held hostage
by what you refuse to be uncomfortable about.

At some point:

- You either choose the discomfort of growth now,
- Or inherit the discomfort of regret later.

Either way, you won't escape pain.
You only get to choose the *kind*.

This week, pick **one deliberate discomfort**:

- Say yes to the opportunity that scares you.
- Start the project you keep researching but never executing.
- Have the conversation that will change a dynamic permanently.

You don't have to burn your life down.
But you do have to stop worshipping comfort
as if it ever turned anyone into who they were called to be.

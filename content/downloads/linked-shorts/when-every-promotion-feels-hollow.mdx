You level up.

New title.
New pay.
New respect.

And for about 48 hours you feel alive.

Then the emptiness returns.





Here's the confrontation:

If your joy depends on the next milestone,
you're not building a career.
You're chasing a mirage.

The goalpost will keep moving
until you move the centre of your life.





You don't need less success.
You need alignment.

Because climbing a ladder
leaning against the wrong wall
is still a loss -
just a prestigious one.

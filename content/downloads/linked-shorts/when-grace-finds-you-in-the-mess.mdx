Some of your lowest moments
weren't loud.

They were quiet:

The day you realised you'd drifted.
The day you broke your own standards.
The day you didn't recognise yourself.

If you're in a mess right now:

Stop bargaining.

Stop promising God a new personality
just to earn relief.

Just come.

Confess what's real.
Name what's broken.
Ask for strength.

Grace is not permission to stay the same.
It's power to become whole.

And sometimes the most shocking thing God does
is not exposing you to destroy you...

but exposing you
so He can finally heal you.

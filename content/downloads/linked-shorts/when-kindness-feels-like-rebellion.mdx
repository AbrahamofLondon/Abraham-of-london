Some people have become harsh
because life trained them.

They call it wisdom.
But sometimes it's just unhealed pain.





Kindness is costly.

It means you don't become what wounded you.

It means you keep your humanity
even when it would be easier to numb it.

This week, choose one act of clean kindness:

- speak gently when you could snap
- honour someone's dignity without performing it
- forgive one small offence without announcing it

In a culture of sharp edges,
gentleness is strength under control.

And sometimes the holiest thing you can do
is refuse to harden.

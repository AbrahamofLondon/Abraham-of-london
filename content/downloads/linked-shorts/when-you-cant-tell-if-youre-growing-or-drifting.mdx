Drifting doesn't feel dramatic.

It feels normal.

You still function.
Still show up.
Still look "fine".

But something inside you is quietly unmooring.





Here's a blunt question:

Are you becoming more **awake**,
or more **busy**?

Because a lot of people don't lose themselves through sin.
They lose themselves through noise.

They don't fall off a cliff.
They slowly step away from what's true
until they can't remember what "true" even felt like.

Tonight, do a real audit:

- What conviction have you been negotiating?
- What truth have you been delaying?
- What voice have you replaced with the crowd's opinion?

If you feel exposed, good.
That's not condemnation.
That's recalibration.

Drifting is not your identity.
It's just what happens when you stop steering.

Not knowing what you want
isn't always confusion.

Sometimes it's exhaustion.

When you've spent years being what others needed,
your own desires start to feel unfamiliar - even suspicious.

Here's the hard diagnosis:

You might not be lost.
You might be unlistening.

Because desire is often the first thing we silence
when we're trying to be responsible, mature, composed.

Try this tonight:

- Write three things you *used* to care about.
- Circle one that still stirs you - even slightly.
- Ask: "What did I trade this for?"

That answer will sting.
Good.

[Clarity](/vault/lexicon/clarity) doesn't always come like a lightning bolt.
Sometimes it comes like a quiet ache
that refuses to die.

Follow the ache.

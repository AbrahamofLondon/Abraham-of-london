Some of you don't make decisions.

You collect permissions.

You ask everyone:

- friends
- mentors
- the internet
- strangers in comments

Then you still feel anxious.

Because the problem isn't lack of advice.

It's lack of trust in yourself.





Here's the truth:

Confidence doesn't come before decisions.
It comes after repeated decisions.

You build it by:

- choosing
- learning
- adjusting
- choosing again
***

This week, reclaim agency:

- decide one small thing without consulting anyone
- follow through
- forgive yourself for imperfection

You don't need perfect outcomes
to trust yourself.

You need evidence that you can recover.

And you can.

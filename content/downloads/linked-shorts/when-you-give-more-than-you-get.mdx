There is a special kind of exhaustion
that doesn't show up on blood tests.

You're not just tired.
You're **drained**.

Because somewhere along the way,
"kind" quietly morphed into "available",
and "available" quietly morphed into "owned".





Here's the uncomfortable audit:

- Who checks on you *first* - without needing something?
- Who has actually changed because of all your advice, your support, your late-night calls?
- Who would notice if you finally stopped rescuing them?

If those answers hurt,
you're not cruel.
You're finally telling yourself the truth.
***

**Love without boundaries is not love.**
It's leakage.

This week:

- Say **no** once where you'd normally say "of course".
- Leave one message **unanswered** until you genuinely have capacity.
- Ask yourself, *"Would I let someone treat my child like this?"*
  If the answer is no, you already know what needs to change.

You are not a bottomless well.
You are a person.

And the people who only know how to drink
will never teach you how to rest.
You'll have to do that yourself.

Sometimes you don't need a new plan.
You need an interruption.

Because your life has become one long continuation:

Same habits.
Same patterns.
Same compromises.

You're not in open sin.
You're just in autopilot.

Here's the hard truth:

God rarely competes with noise.

If you keep your life loud,
you will keep missing Him
and then blame Him for being "silent."

This week, create space for interruption:

- one hour with no phone
- one walk with no music
- one prayer that is mostly listening

Ask one question and stop talking:

"Lord, what have I been ignoring?"

If you fear the answer, that's a clue.

Divine interruption isn't punishment.
It's rescue.

Because sometimes the most loving thing God does
is disrupt the life you built
so He can rebuild the life you were meant for.

At some point, you stopped speaking.

Not literally.
But spiritually.

You started choosing the safest version of yourself:

- the agreeable version
- the filtered version
- the "don't cause trouble" version

And people liked you for it.

Here's the hard truth:

If your peace depends on everybody approving of you,
you don't have peace.
You have management.

This week, reclaim your voice in small ways:

- choose one preference without explaining it
- say no once without guilt
- write one page of what you actually think

Your voice may feel unfamiliar at first.
That's normal.

You haven't lost it.
You've just been living on mute.

And healing often begins
the day you stop auditioning
and start speaking like you belong to yourself.

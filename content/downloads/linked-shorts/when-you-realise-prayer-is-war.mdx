Some prayers are not poetic.

They're survival.

They're not "quiet time."
They're warfare.

Because you're not just praying for outcomes.
You're praying against discouragement, confusion, temptation, despair.
You are grasping for imput.





Here's the hard truth:

Some victories come
only through stubborn persistence.

Not because God is slow,
but because you're being trained to stand.
***

This week, don't make prayer a performance.

Make it a posture:

- pray when you don't feel like it
- pray briefly but consistently
- pray specifically
- pray with Scripture when your words run out

The battle isn't always in your schedule.

Sometimes it's in your spirit.

Do it until that becomes your everytime.

And the people who win long-term
are the ones who keep praying
when nothing looks like it's moving.

That's not delusion.

That's faith under pressure.

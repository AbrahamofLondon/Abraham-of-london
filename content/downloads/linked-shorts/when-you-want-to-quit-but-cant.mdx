You've tried to quit.

Not loudly. Not dramatically.
Quietly.

You've tried to shrink your dreams.
Lower your expectations.
Settle into "manageable".

But something in you keeps resisting the downgrade.

Here's what they don't tell you:

Calling is not just inspiration.
It's obligation.

Not to the crowd.
To the Author of your life.

And yes, it's heavy sometimes.
Because it forces you to grow into a person
who can carry what you keep praying for.

This week, don't "quit" the whole thing.

Just do this:

- Quit the fake pace.
- Quit the need for applause.
- Quit the habit of carrying it alone.

You don't need a new life.
You need a sustainable way to live the one you're called to.

Some assignments can't be quit.
They can only be refined.

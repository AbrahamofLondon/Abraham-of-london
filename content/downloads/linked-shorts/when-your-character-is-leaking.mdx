Character doesn't collapse in one day.

It leaks.

A little dishonesty.
A little excuse.
A little rationalisation.

Nothing dramatic -
just enough to keep you comfortable.





Here's the leadership reality:

People don't follow what you claim.
They follow what you consistently are.

And eventually, whatever you're hiding
will surface as:

- disrespect
- instability
- confusion
- quiet self-contempt

You can't lead people past a point
you refuse to lead yourself.

This week, locate one leak:

- one lie you keep telling yourself
- one habit that's eroding you
- one area where your values don't govern your behaviour

Then do something adult:

Fix it.

Not with a speech.
With a decision.

Because charisma can cover leaks for a while.
But pressure exposes everything.

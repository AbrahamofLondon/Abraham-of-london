You know how to walk into a room
like you belong there.

You've rehearsed the handshake, the eye contact,
the perfectly timed laugh.

People call you "confident".
If only they knew how much work that word costs you.





Real confidence is quieter, almost boring:

- You can say *"I don't know"*
  without your world collapsing.
- You can say *"That's not for me"*
  without drafting a 3-page justification.
- You can be wrong
  without becoming worthless.

Confidence is not a costume you put on.
It's the peace of knowing you're not performing for a jury.
***

This week, practice **unpolished honesty** once:

- Admit a gap in your knowledge out loud.
- Ask a "basic" question in a room that intimidates you.
- Share one fear with someone safe.

Not everything powerful has to look polished.

Sometimes the most confident thing you can do
is let people meet the version of you
who hasn't fully figured it out yet.

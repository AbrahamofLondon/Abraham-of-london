There are days when you don't doubt God.
You just don't feel **anything**.

The songs don't land.
The verses feel flat.
Everyone else looks "on fire"
and you're doing well just to show up as a functioning human.

Let's name it plainly:

You are not a machine.
You are not a 24/7 worship stream.
You are a human being with a nervous system, a history, and limits.





## 2. You don't have to fake warmth you don't feel

You don't fix numbness by pretending to be "on fire".

You fix numbness by doing the most honest thing you can do:

&gt; "God, I feel nothing.
&gt; I don't even know what to say.
&gt; But I'm here."

That's not weak.
That's **alignment**.





You don't have to manufacture a feeling.
You just have to keep turning, even slightly, in the right direction.

The fire will not always be this dim.
But even when it is, it's still **fire**.

Let it warm your soul.

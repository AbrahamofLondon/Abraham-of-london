Having standards is good.

Low standards ruin lives.

But there's a trap:
sometimes "standards" become camouflage for fear.

You don't just want quality people.
You want safety.

So you raise the bar so high
nobody can reach you.





Here's the uncomfortable question:

Are your standards filtering out chaos -
or filtering out intimacy?

Because real relationships require tolerance:

- for imperfect delivery
- for misunderstanding
- for human error

If your standard is "never disappoint me,"
you're not looking for a person.
You're looking for an environment you can control.

This week, keep your standards -
but check your walls:

- Identify one standard that is really a fear.
- Practice vulnerability once with someone safe.
- Allow one person to be human without disqualifying them.

Discernment is wisdom.
But isolation is not a virtue.

Sometimes the thing you call "high standards"
is just loneliness with good grammar.

Some people fear failing.
You secretly fear **proving yourself right**.

Because if you are as capable
as your spirit keeps hinting,
then you can no longer hide behind:

- "No one ever gave me a chance."
- "Maybe I'm just average."
- "It's not that deep."

Success would expose you.
It would demand things from you
laziness and fear currently protect you from.





The uncomfortable truth:

You're not stuck because of a lack of clarity.
You're stuck because of a lack of **decision**.

At some point you will have to choose:

- Do I want the comfort of my current story?
- Or the responsibility of the version of me
  I know I could become?

Both are costly.
Only one is worthy.

This week, do something that commits you:

- Pay for the course.
- Announce the date.
- Send the email.
- Apply for the role.

Make a move your future self will be forced to steward.

You are not afraid of failure.
You're afraid that heaven's opinion of you
might actually be accurate.

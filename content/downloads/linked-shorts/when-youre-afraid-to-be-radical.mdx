Most people don't fear sin.

They fear obedience
that costs them comfort.

Because radical obedience isn't dramatic.

It's not always "mission trips" and "big moves."

Sometimes it's:

- telling the truth when lying would be easier
- keeping your integrity when it costs money
- cutting off what feeds your lust
- forgiving when you'd rather punish
- choosing holiness when no one is watching


{/* stripped: duplicate frontmatter block */}


This week, choose one uncomfortable obedience:

- end a compromise
- repent quickly
- make restitution
- do what you know is right without announcing it

Radical faith is not for show.

It's for freedom.

And freedom always costs something.

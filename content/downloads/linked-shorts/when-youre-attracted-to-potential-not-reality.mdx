Some of you don't date people.

You date potential.

You don't fall for their character --
you fall for your own imagination.

You see:

- "If they healed…"
- "If they matured…"
- "If they understood me…"
- "If they stopped doing that…"

And you call it love.





Love requires honesty.

Not fantasy.

Reality says:

- Are they consistent?
- Do they honour you?
- Do their habits match their words?
- Do they take responsibility?

If not, your "hope" is not virtue.
It's self-deception.

This week, choose reality:

- stop negotiating red flags
- stop calling inconsistency "complexity"
- stop treating basic effort like a miracle

You don't need someone with potential.

You need someone with character.

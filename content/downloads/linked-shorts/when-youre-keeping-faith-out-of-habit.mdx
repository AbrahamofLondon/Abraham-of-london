There's a phase of faith that nobody romanticises.

You still attend.
Still pray.
Still say the right words.

But inside, it feels... flat.

Like you're doing faith the way you brush your teeth:
because you're supposed to.





Here's the uncomfortable invitation:

God can handle your honesty.

Not your polished lines.
Not your rehearsed gratitude.

Your real sentence:
"I don't feel You."
"I'm tired."
"I don't understand."
"I'm disappointed."

That is not rebellion.
That is relationship.

This week:

- Pray one prayer without religious language.
- Read one Psalm that tells the truth without apology.
- Sit for five minutes and stop performing.

Faith isn't proven by constant intensity.
It's proven by refusal to fake it.

Habit can keep you near.
Honesty brings you back alive.

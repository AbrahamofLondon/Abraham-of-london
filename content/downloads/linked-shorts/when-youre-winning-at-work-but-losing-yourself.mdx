You're getting it done.

Deadlines met.
Metrics up.
Emails answered.

People say you're "on fire".

But the truth is uglier:
you're burning.





Here's the confrontation:

If your job disappeared tomorrow,
who would you be?

Not what would you do - who would you be?

If that question makes you panic,
you're not ambitious.
You're attached.

This week:

- Take one hour that cannot be monetised.
- Do something that restores you with no audience.
- Say no once to prove you still have a spine.

Work is a tool.
Not a throne.

And if your success costs your soul,
it's not success.
It's a well-decorated loss.

Metrics are useful.

But if you're not careful,
they become gods.

You start living for numbers:

- followers
- income
- titles
- wins
- applause

And you ignore what can't be graphed:

- peace
- integrity
- family
- character
- devotion





Some people don't lose their lives through sin.
They lose their lives through optimisation.

They become efficient at everything
except being whole.

This week, create new metrics:

- Did I live honestly today?
- Did I do what I said I would do?
- Did I love people without using them?
- Did I obey God in small things?

If your numbers are up
but your soul is down,
that's not growth.

That's drift.

Fix the metric,
or the metric will finish you.

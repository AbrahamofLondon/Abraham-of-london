## Why This Kit?

Good mentorship changes trajectories.  
Badly structured mentorship **wastes time and breeds quiet frustration**.

This starter kit gives you a **lightweight structure** for the first 90 days of a mentoring relationship - whether you are the mentor or the mentee.

## 1. Clarify the Relationship

Use these questions in the first meeting:

**For the mentee:**

- _"Why do you want a mentor now?"_
- _"What would 'success' look like after 6-12 months?"_
- _"What three areas do you most want to grow in?"_

**For the mentor:**

- _"Where do I realistically have capacity to help?"_
- _"What will I not be able to provide?"_

Agree clearly:

- Primary focus (e.g. career, leadership, faith, relationships, entrepreneurship)
- Meeting frequency (e.g. monthly / every 6 weeks)
- Typical duration (e.g. 60-75 minutes)

## 2. Ground Rules

Suggested covenant:

1. **Confidentiality:** what is shared stays in the mentoring space, unless there is risk of harm.
2. **Honesty:** we will not pretend or perform.
3. **Responsibility:** the mentee owns their life; the mentor is a guide, not a saviour.
4. **Preparation:** mentee comes with questions, updates and decisions to discuss.
5. **Boundaries:** we respect family time, work commitments and communication limits.

You can literally read this aloud and agree together.

## 3. Meeting Template

A simple agenda:

1. **Check-in (10-15 mins)**

   - What has happened since we last met?
   - Highlights? Low points? Any surprises?

2. **Deep dive (30-40 mins)**

   - One or two key themes: decision, conflict, opportunity, pattern.
   - Ask questions before giving advice.

3. **Decisions & actions (10-15 mins)**

   - What will you DO before our next meeting?
   - What obstacles do you anticipate?

4. **Encouragement & challenge (5 mins)**
   - Name one strength.
   - Name one area to watch or work on.

If you share faith, you can close with a short prayer. If not, still close with **intentional encouragement**.

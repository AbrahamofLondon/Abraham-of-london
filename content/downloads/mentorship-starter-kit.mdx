# Mentorship Starter Kit — 90-Day Covenant

<PullLine subtle>Mentoring is intentional; not accidental. The Covenant frames the seriousness of the commitment.</PullLine>

## Frame the Relationship
- **Purpose:** growth in character, craft, and calling. 
- **Cadence:** 3×/month (45–60 mins), one in-person if possible. 
- **Confidentiality:** stories stay in the room; safety exceptions.

<Rule />

## First 30 Days — Discovery
- Story map: origins, strengths, wounds, non-negotiables. 
- Assessment: 360° from 3 voices; pick 1 growth theme. 
- Plan: 3 habits, 1 project, 1 relationship to repair.

<Rule />

## Days 31–60 — Practice
- Weekly reps tied to the theme (streak tracker). 
- **Shadow / Show:** observe once; demonstrate once. 
- Feedback: *facts → feelings → fixes*.

<Rule />

## Days 61–90 — Stretch
- Challenge: public commitment with a date. 
- Teach-back: mentee teaches the principle to someone else. 
- Review: renew, redefine, or release.

<Rule />

## One-Page Covenant (Template)
We commit for 90 days to honesty, punctuality, preparation, and follow-through. 
**Mentor:** presence, questions, introductions. 
**Mentee:** agenda, notes, execution.

<PullLine subtle>Mentoring is intentional; not accidental. The Covenant frames the seriousness of the commitment.</PullLine>

## Frame the Relationship
* **Purpose:** growth in character, craft, and calling.
* **Cadence:** 3×/month (45–60 mins), one in-person if possible.
* **Confidentiality:** stories stay in the room; safety exceptions.

<Rule />

## First 30 Days — Discovery
* Story map: origins, strengths, wounds, non-negotiables.
* Assessment: 360° from 3 voices; pick 1 growth theme.
* Plan: 3 habits, 1 project, 1 relationship to repair.

<Rule />

<h2>Days 31–60 — Practice</h2>
* Weekly reps tied to the theme (streak tracker).
* **Shadow / Show:** observe once; demonstrate once.
* **Feedback:** *facts → feelings → fixes*.

<Rule />

<h2>Days 61–90 — Stretch</h2>
* Challenge: public commitment with a date.
* Teach-back: mentee teaches the principle to someone else.
* Review: renew, redefine, or release.

<Rule />

<h2>One-Page Covenant (Template)</h2>
<p className="mb-6">
  We commit for 90 days to honesty, punctuality, preparation, and follow-through.
  **Mentor:** presence, questions, introductions.
  **Mentee:** agenda, notes, execution.

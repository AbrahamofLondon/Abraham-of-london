## A Note From Your [Father](/lexicon/father)

My son,

I am writing these principles so that, whatever life throws at us, you will never be in doubt about **what I believe, what I pray for you, and how I expect you to walk as a man**.

These are not slogans. They are **anchors** for when life feels confusing, unfair or overwhelming.

## 2. Guard Your [Integrity](/lexicon/integrity) at All Costs

There are things you can lose and recover: money, deals, opportunities.
There are things you cannot easily recover: **trust, honour, credibility**.

- Say what you mean.
- Do what you said you would do.
- If you fail, own it quickly and repair it fully.

I would rather see you **honest and struggling** than successful and crooked.

## 4. Work Hard, Work Smart, Rest Well

Laziness will quietly erode your potential.
Workaholism will quietly erode your soul.

- Learn to **work hard** - with focus, discipline and excellence.
- Learn to **work smart** - prioritise, think, plan.
- Learn to **rest well** - sleep, take breaks, enjoy beauty and silence.

You are not a machine. You are a man created for **purpose, not just output**.

## 6. Choose Your Friends Carefully

The people you walk with will shape:

- Your habits
- Your decisions
- Your vision of what is "normal"

Walk with men who:

- Tell you the truth
- Challenge you when you drift
- Celebrate your growth without envy

Do not confuse **attention** with **loyalty**.

## 8. Learn to Handle Money Wisely

Money is a tool, not a master.

- Live below your means.
- Avoid unnecessary debt.
- Give generously and quietly.
- Save and invest with patience, not greed.

If you master your appetites, you will not be easily mastered by money.

## 10. Build for [Legacy](/lexicon/legacy), Not Just for Today

Life is short. Eternity is long. People are watching even when you think they are not.

Ask yourself often:

- _"What am I building that will outlive me?"_
- _"What kind of story will my life tell about God, about manhood, about fatherhood?"_

I want you to live in such a way that **your children and their children** can thank God for the decisions you made.

## Final Word

My son,

You will make mistakes. So did I. So will every man you admire.
What matters is that you **keep returning to truth, to God, and to who you are called to be.**

Whatever happens:

&gt; _You are my son. I love you. I want you to stand, to build, and to walk without fear._

Your father.

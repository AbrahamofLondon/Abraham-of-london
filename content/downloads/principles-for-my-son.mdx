<h2>The Twelve Standards</h2>
<ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-3">
  <li>**Presence.** We show up—on time, prepared, attentive.</li>
  <li>**Truth.** We tell the truth without spin; we confess fast, not last.</li>
  <li>**Work.** We finish what we start and keep small promises.</li>
  <li>**Stewardship.** We budget, save, give, and repair what we own.</li>
  <li>**Courage.** We do hard, right things—especially when unseen.</li>
  <li>**Honor.** We dignify women, elders, and authorities; we protect the weak.</li>
  <li>**Speech.** We speak cleanly—no gossip, slander, or coarse talk.</li>
  <li>**Learning.** We read, ask, practice; we receive correction with humility.</li>
  <li>**Health.** We sleep, train, eat simply, and keep our devices in their place.</li>
  <li>**Craft.** We build things that work and are worth keeping.</li>
  <li>**Service.** We lift burdens at home first, then beyond the door.</li>
  <li>**Faith.** We listen for God, obey promptly, and stay planted in truth.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Daily Rhythm</h3>
* **Morning:** Scripture + 5 min silent prayer; bed made; device parked.
* **Work/School:** One thing done to completion; one kindness given.
* **Evening:** Debrief: *truth, one win, one next step*. Read for 15 minutes.

<Rule />

<h3>Weekly Touchpoints</h3>
* **Sunday Check-in (20 min):** Review standards; pick one focus.
* **Skill Block (60 min):** Hands + head: a skill, a book, a task.
* **Service (30–60 min):** A small act beyond ourselves.

<Rule />

<h2>Father–Son Pledge</h2>
<PullLine subtle>
  We commit to these standards with courage and joy. We will correct in love, receive correction with humility,
  and keep small promises over time. Our name will be known for presence, truth, and service.

<h3>How to Use</h3>
* Print and post; underline one standard to focus on this week.
* Track one daily micro-habit; celebrate completion, not perfection.
* Quarterly: re-sign the pledge and raise the standard 1%.

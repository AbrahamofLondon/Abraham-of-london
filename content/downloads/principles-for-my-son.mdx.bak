      ## The 12 Standards

      1.  **Truth:** Speak plainly. Do not lie, excuse, or equivocate.
      2.  **Order:** Master your time, your space, and your word. Chaos is costly.
      3.  **Labour:** Work with excellence. Do not need to be managed.
      4.  **Altar:** Worship daily. God examines your household first.
      5.  **Courage:** Act with conviction. Fear is control's currency.
      6.  **Brotherhood:** Defend your man. Speak life, not slander.
      7.  **Sovereignty:** Own your outcomes. Blame is weakness.
      8.  **Grace:** Show mercy. Forgive fiercely and quickly.
      9.  **Stewardship:** Rule your money. Do not love debt.
      10. **Tone:** Lead with kindness. Never use sarcasm or contempt.
      11. **Legacy:** Build what lasts. The measure of a man is his son's character.
      12. **Presence:** Be here now. Listen with your eyes.

      <Rule />

      ## The Charge

      The world does not need another talented man; it needs another **principled man**. This is the standard.

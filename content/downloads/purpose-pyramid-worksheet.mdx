# [Purpose](/lexicon/purpose) Pyramid Worksheet

{"The Purpose Pyramid is not a brainstorming exercise; it is a structural audit of your time and resources."}

This worksheet is designed to force clarity by aligning your highest mandate with your most immediate actions. If the layers do not connect, you are experiencing "Strategic Drift."

## The Architectural Hierarchy



### 1. The Apex: [Purpose](/lexicon/purpose)
* **Question**: What are you building that is worth the cost?
* **Standard**: This must be objective, enduring, and non-emotional.

### 2. The Mid-Tier: Priorities (The Quarter)
* **Question**: Which 3 outcomes move the needle toward the Apex?
* **Standard**: If everything is a priority, nothing is. Limit to three.

### 3. The Base: Proof (The Daily)
* **Question**: What evidence exists today that you are pursuing these priorities?
* **Standard**: High-integrity execution requires a "Definition of Done" for daily blocks.

## Operating Instructions

1.  **Print & File**: Do not leave this as a digital ghost. Print it, fill it by hand, and file it in your Institutional Ledger.
2.  **Quarterly Cadence**: Perform this audit every 90 days.
3.  **The Drift Check**: If your daily "Proof" does not clearly support your quarterly "Priorities," **stop execution** and re-align.

<Callout type="info">
  {"Success is the accumulation of aligned days. The Pyramid ensures no day is wasted on noise."}

# Purpose Pyramid Worksheet

This is a **fillable** execution worksheet.

## Use it to:
- Define the real “why” without drifting into slogans
- Convert purpose into **priorities and proofs**
- Identify constraints early (money, time, authority, capacity)
- Produce a one-page operating focus for the next 30–90 days

> If you can’t operationalise it, you don’t own it yet.

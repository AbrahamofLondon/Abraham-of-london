# Scripture Track - John 14

**Assurance - Obedience - The Helper - Peace**

&gt; "Let not your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me."
&gt; - John 14:1

## Key Verses & Reflections

### 1. Assurance: "I Go to Prepare a Place for You" (vv. 1-4)

**John 14:1-3**

&gt; "Let not your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me. In my [Father](/vault/lexicon/father)'s house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also."

**Reflection:**
Jesus doesn't promise that life will be painless. He promises **presence**. Your anxiety about tomorrow, your fear of loss, your uncertainty-none of it changes this: **He has gone ahead to secure your place.** You are not wandering. You are being led home.

**Application:**
When anxiety rises, ask: _Am I trusting Jesus with my future, or am I demanding control?_ Write down one fear and speak John 14:1 over it.

### 2. The Way, The Truth, The Life (vv. 5-7)

**John 14:6**

&gt; "I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the [Father](/vault/lexicon/father) except through me."

**Reflection:**
In a pluralistic world, this statement offends. But Jesus isn't being exclusive; He's being **definitive**. Truth isn't a buffet; it's a Person. The way isn't a technique; it's relationship with Christ. The life isn't self-actualization; it's resurrection power.

**Application:**
Where are you looking for "way" outside of Jesus? Strategy, relationships, success? Re-center on Christ as the only reliable path.

### 3. Greater Works Through Faith (vv. 12-14)

**John 14:12**

&gt; "Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I am going to the [Father](/vault/lexicon/father)."

**Reflection:**
Jesus ascends to the [Father](/vault/lexicon/father), sends the Spirit, and mobilizes the church globally. The "greater works" aren't greater in _quality_ (we can't outdo Christ), but in _scope_-the Gospel goes to every nation. You are part of that mission. Your obedience, powered by the Spirit, advances the Kingdom.

**Application:**
What is one act of obedience you've been delaying? Pray. Act. Trust the Spirit to work through you.

### 4. The Promise of the Helper (vv. 15-18, 25-26)

**John 14:16-17**

&gt; "And I will ask the [Father](/vault/lexicon/father), and he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you."

**Reflection:**
The Holy Spirit isn't a vague force; He's **God with you**. Not just near you, but _in_ you. This changes everything: guidance isn't guessing; comfort isn't distant; power isn't external.

**Application:**
When you feel alone or powerless, remind yourself: **The Spirit lives in me.** Pray accordingly.

### 5. Peace: Not as the World Gives (v. 27)

**John 14:27**

&gt; "Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid."

**Reflection:**
The world's peace depends on circumstances: good health, financial security, stable relationships. **Christ's peace is independent of circumstances.** It's the peace of being reconciled to God, knowing you're held by Him, and trusting His sovereignty even when life is chaos.

**Application:**
Where are you chasing the world's peace (comfort, control, approval) instead of resting in Christ's peace? Confess it. Choose trust over control.

## Memory Verses

Commit these to memory. Write them on cards. Speak them when anxiety rises.

**John 14:1**

&gt; "Let not your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me."

**John 14:6**

&gt; "I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the [Father](/vault/lexicon/father) except through me."

**John 14:27**

&gt; "Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid."

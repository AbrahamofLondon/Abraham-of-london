## Key Verses & Reflections

### 1. Assurance: "I Go to Prepare a Place for You" (vv. 1-4)

**John 14:1-3**

> "Let not your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me. In my Father's house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also."

**Reflection:**
Jesus doesn't promise that life will be painless. He promises **presence**. Your anxiety about tomorrow, your fear of loss, your uncertainty-none of it changes this: **He has gone ahead to secure your place.** You are not wandering. You are being led home.

**Application:**
When anxiety rises, ask: _Am I trusting Jesus with my future, or am I demanding control?_ Write down one fear and speak John 14:1 over it.

### 3. Greater Works Through Faith (vv. 12-14)

**John 14:12**

> "Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I am going to the Father."

**Reflection:**
Jesus ascends to the Father, sends the Spirit, and mobilizes the church globally. The "greater works" aren't greater in _quality_ (we can't outdo Christ), but in _scope_-the Gospel goes to every nation. You are part of that mission. Your obedience, powered by the Spirit, advances the Kingdom.

**Application:**
What is one act of obedience you've been delaying? Pray. Act. Trust the Spirit to work through you.

### 5. Peace: Not as the World Gives (v. 27)

**John 14:27**

> "Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid."

**Reflection:**
The world's peace depends on circumstances: good health, financial security, stable relationships. **Christ's peace is independent of circumstances.** It's the peace of being reconciled to God, knowing you're held by Him, and trusting His sovereignty even when life is chaos.

**Application:**
Where are you chasing the world's peace (comfort, control, approval) instead of resting in Christ's peace? Confess it. Choose trust over control.

## Memory Verses

Commit these to memory. Write them on cards. Speak them when anxiety rises.

**John 14:1**

> "Let not your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me."

**John 14:6**

> "I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."

**John 14:27**

> "Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid."

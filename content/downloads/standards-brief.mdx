{/* import EmbossedBrandMark from "@/components/EmbossedBrandMark" */}

## 1) Decisions


  * <strong>Facts first:</strong> single source of truth; date every number.
  * <strong>Owner and deadline:</strong> one accountable person; one explicit
    date.
  * <strong>Reversible vs. irreversible:</strong> bias to speed on reversible
    calls.


## 2) Cadence


  * <strong>Daily:</strong> status, blockers, risks (15m).
  * <strong>Weekly:</strong> outcomes scored, lessons captured, next 3 (45m).
  * <strong>Monthly:</strong> standards review, debt burn-down, runway check.


## 3) Communication


  * <strong>Write it down:</strong> decisions, assumptions, follow-ups.
  * <strong>No triangulation:</strong> speak to, not about.
  * <strong>Plain English:</strong> short, dated, action-oriented notes.


## 4) Workmanship


  * <strong>Definition of done:</strong> clear acceptance criteria, demoable.
  * <strong>Durability:</strong> simple, testable, documented.
  * <strong>Name:</strong> work that carries your name must be worth keeping.


## 5) Security


  * <strong>Least privilege:</strong> access by role; revoke on exit same day.
  * <strong>Keys and secrets:</strong> rotate quarterly; never in chat or
    code.
  * <strong>Incident drill:</strong> who calls whom; first hour playbook.


## 6) Release Discipline


  * <strong>Branch, test, tag:</strong> no ad-hoc deploys; rollback ready.
  * <strong>Notes:</strong> concise change log with risks and smoke checks.
  * <strong>Post-mortems:</strong> blameless, dated, with two preventions.

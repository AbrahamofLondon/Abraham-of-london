## The Daily Time Blocks (Template)

Use these time blocks to structure your most productive 4-hour window (e.g., 9:00 AM â€” 1:00 PM).

- **Focus (90m):** Deep, high-leverage work toward Top 3 outcomes. Zero distractions.
- **Admin (45m):** Clearing email, quick communication, expense reports. Batch tasks here.
- **People (45m):** Meetings, calls, coaching, check-ins. External-facing work.
- **Buffer (30m):** Rest, transition, unexpected fires, or prep for the next block.

<Note tone="key" title="Rule of 3">
Start every Monday by writing down your **Top 3 Outcomes** for the week. If you hit those 3, the week was a success.

# Weekly Operating Rhythm & Daily Blocks

<PullLine subtle>Your calendar reflects your priorities. Guard your focus blocks ruthlessly.</PullLine>

## The Weekly Cadence

| Day | Focus Activity | Output/Goal |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Monday** | **Planning & Audit** | Top 3 Outcomes set. Calendar is clean. |
| **Tuesday-Thursday** | **Execution & Focus** | Deep work blocks completed. Progress on Top 3. |
| **Friday** | **Review & Preview** | Outcomes scored (0-1). Learnings captured. Next week's calendar blocked. |

<Rule />

## The Daily Time Blocks (Template)

Use these time blocks to structure your most productive 4-hour window (e.g., 9:00 AM â€“ 1:00 PM).

- **Focus (90m):** Deep, high-leverage work toward Top 3 outcomes. Zero distractions.
- **Admin (45m):** Clearing email, quick communication, expense reports. Batch tasks here.
- **People (45m):** Meetings, calls, coaching, check-ins. External-facing work.
- **Buffer (30m):** Rest, transition, unexpected fires, or prep for the next block.

<Note tone="key" title="Rule of 3">
Start every Monday by writing down your **Top 3 Outcomes** for the week. If you hit those 3, the week was a success.

# Weekly Operating Rhythm — Make Standards Breathe

## Cadence
- **Mon 20** — priorities + risks (20 mins).  
- **Mid-week 15** — unblock.  
- **Fri 20** — scoreboard + commitments.

## Hygiene
- Written agenda. Start sharp. End with owners + dates.  
- If a meeting has no decision, it becomes a document.

Includes a printable agenda and scoreboard.

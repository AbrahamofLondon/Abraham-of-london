_Salon · Invitation-Only · Chatham_

A guided room for **principals who carry weight**—where we swap posturing for stewardship. We examine decisions through the lens of legacy: capital allocation, family order, and the culture you’re building on purpose *(or by drift)*.

## Format

Short provocation → round-table → practical tools. Drinks afterwards for the conversations that need the corner of the room.

## Topics we’ll touch

- Power and restraint: **what you can do** vs **what you should do**.  
- Succession without sentimentality.  
- Operating cadence for principals: from board to breakfast table.  
- Building brotherhood around mission, not momentum.

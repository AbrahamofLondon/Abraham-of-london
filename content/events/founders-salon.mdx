<HeroEyebrow>Private • Off the Record • By Invitation</HeroEyebrow>

A long-form conversation for founders and principals. We cover clarity (seeing cleanly), capital (stewarding wisely),
and character (living standards that hold under pressure).

**Format:** short opening frame → guided roundtable → practical closes.  
**Outcome:** better decisions, stronger conviction, and a brotherhood you can call.

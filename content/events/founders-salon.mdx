**An evening built for owners.** Signal over noise, with standards you can put to work tomorrow. Seating is deliberately limited.

---

## What to expect

- **Sharper standards** that hold under pressure  
- **Stewardship in practice** — teams, capital, reputation  
- **Decision-making for the long arc** — beyond quarterly optics  
- Candid discussion; no recordings, no press

> “No noise. Just the signal you need to make enduring decisions.”

## Who this is for

Principals, owners, and senior operators who carry responsibility — and refuse to outsource judgment to trends or groupthink.

---

## Format (90 minutes)

1. Opening brief — *clarity, capital, character*  
2. Casework & frameworks  
3. Salon conversation (off-the-record)  
4. Closing standards & next steps

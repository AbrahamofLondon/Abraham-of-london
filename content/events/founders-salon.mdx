# Founder's Salon

## *An evening for high-trust leadership and legacy thinking.*

There are rooms where ideas are shared — and there are rooms where history is shaped.

The Founder’s Salon is not a conference. It’s a table.
It’s where leaders come open-handed, ready to gain clarity, challenge assumptions, and cultivate relationships that outlast the noise of this age.

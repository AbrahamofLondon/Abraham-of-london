# Founders Salon

## _An evening for high-trust leadership and legacy thinking._

There are rooms where ideas are shared -- and rooms where history is shaped.

**Founders Salon is not a conference.** It's a table: discreet, deliberate, and built for leaders who want clarity without theatre.

This is for founders and board-level operators navigating:

- irreversible decisions
- reputational risk
- capital, governance, and long-horizon strategy
- the cost of leadership when the cameras are gone

## Format

- **Arrival + welcome:** 19:00
- **Dinner + salon session:** 19:30-21:30
- **Close + next steps:** 21:30-22:00

Location is shared **only after confirmation**.

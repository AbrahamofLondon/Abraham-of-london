# Founders’ Salon — London

**Chatham presentation.** Off the record. No recordings. No press.  
**An evening built for owners.** Signal over noise, with standards you can put to work tomorrow.

> “No noise. Just the signal you need to make enduring decisions.”

- **Sharper standards** that hold under pressure  
- **Stewardship in practice** — teams, capital, reputation  
- **Long-arc decisions** — beyond quarterly optics; protect the franchise

---

## Who It’s For

Principals, owners, and senior operators who set culture—and carry the consequences.

---

## Format (90 minutes)

1. Opening brief — *clarity, capital, character*  
2. Casework & frameworks  
3. Salon conversation (off the record)  
4. Closing standards & next steps

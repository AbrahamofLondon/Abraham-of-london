# Leadership Workshop — Standards that Endure

## The Standard

The modern leader is drowning in input, starved of clear standards. This is a working session for principals, not performers. The goal is to exit with **one structural decision** that generates non-negotiable capital (financial, relational, or spiritual).

<Rule />

## The Room (Chatham House Rules)

* **Small:** 12–16 Principals (max).
* **High Trust:** No pitches, no photos, no attribution.
* **Outcome Focused:** We do not talk about the problem; we **design the solution**.

<blockquote>
**Who it's for**
: Principals who need clarity, not consensus. Men who want to lead their household first.
</blockquote>

<Rule />

## Focus Areas

### 1. Internal Audit (The Standard)

* **The Altar:** Where does your private practice need discipline?
* **The Cadence:** Design a weekly operating rhythm that protects time and focus.
* **The Tone:** Removing sarcasm and contempt from your speech.

### 2. External Leverage (The Strategy)

* **Capital:** Identifying high-leverage decisions in your business/mission.
* **Stewardship:** How to vet opportunities and decline distractions.
* **Brotherhood:** Building your band of brothers for accountability and defense.

<Rule />

<Note tone="key" title="Deliverables">
  Attendees leave with a **Personal Standards Blueprint**, a **Weekly Operating Rhythm**, and a **Pre-vetted Brotherhood Call Tree**.
</Note>

<PullLine subtle>
  We don't just fight for access. We fight for **impact**. Something always happens.
</PullLine>

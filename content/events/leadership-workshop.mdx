<HeroEyebrow>Workshop • Limited Seats • Chatham</HeroEyebrow>

**Meekness is not weakness; it’s power under control.** In this private workshop we rebuild the core disciplines that
make leaders durable: conviction, clarity, and standards that don’t bend with the weather.

### What you’ll work on

- Craft a personal leadership standard worth following.
- Install a weekly operating rhythm (30•60•90 playbook).
- Practice high-signal communication—especially under pressure.
- Learn to build brotherhood around mission, not drama.

<Callout tone="key" title="Who it’s for">
Founders, principals, heads of household, and senior leaders who want standards that *last*.

# Leadership Workshop

## _Authority is not a tone — it's a track record._

Build your leadership bottom-up, the way legacies endure: intention, conviction, and consistency.

In this full-day workshop, we’ll unpack frameworks from fatherhood, military philosophy, biblical wisdom, and behavioural science to rebuild how you **lead yourself, your family, and your organisation.**

### Key Sessions

- Operating from principle vs. pressure
- Clarifying identity and conviction
- Managing power and responsibility
- Leading people through storms

* real exercises, legacy prompts, and workbook tools to take into Monday.

> “Leadership starts with building yourself. Authority begins with truth.”

_Workshop · Limited Seats · Chatham_

**Meekness is not weakness; it’s power under control.** In this private workshop we rebuild the core disciplines that make leaders durable—conviction, clarity, and standards that don’t bend with the weather.

## What you’ll work on
- Craft a personal leadership standard worth following.
- Install a weekly operating rhythm (30•60•90 playbook).
- Practice high-signal communication—especially under pressure.
- Build brotherhood around mission, not drama.

> **Who it’s for**  
> Founders, principals, heads of household, and senior leaders who want standards that _last_.

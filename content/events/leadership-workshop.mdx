# Leadership Workshop — London

**Chatham presentation.** Off the record. No recordings. No press.  
A **small-room working session** for leaders building beyond the quarter—and beyond their lifetime.

> “No noise. Just the signal you need to make enduring decisions.”

## What You’ll Get
- **Standards under fire** — how to hold course when pressure is relentless  
- **Practical stewardship** — operating frameworks for teams, families, and enterprises  
- **The long arc** — decisions that protect legacy and compound influence

## Work We’ll Do
1. **Clarity** — define non-negotiables; kill ambiguity  
2. **Conviction** — model courage without theatrics  
3. **Cadence** — operationalise standards (weekly mechanisms, not slogans)

## Format (Working Session)
- Opening brief — *standards that endure*  
- Casework & frameworks  
- Table discussion (Chatham House Rule)  
- Close — personal standards checklist

## Chatham Notes
- **Chatham House Rule**: use the ideas; don’t attribute comments, identities, or affiliations  
- **Devices**: silent; no photos or posts  
- **Attire**: smart casual  
- **Arrival**: doors open 15 minutes before start  
- **Capacity**: **16** seats

Seats are strictly limited. This is an **invitation-only** room in London.  
If you’re ready to lead with standards that outlast headlines, request your place.

_Workshop · Limited Seats · Chatham_

**Meekness is not weakness; it’s power under control.** In this private workshop we rebuild the core disciplines that make leaders durable—conviction, clarity, and standards that don’t bend with the weather.

## What you’ll work on

- Craft a personal leadership standard worth following.  
- Install a weekly operating rhythm *(30•60•90 playbook)*.  
- Practice high-signal communication—especially under pressure.  
- Learn to build brotherhood around mission, not drama.

:::Note
**Who it’s for** — Founders, principals, heads of household, and senior leaders who want standards that **last**.
:::

### Format

Half-day intensive. Short lecture bursts, live case work, and practical tools you can deploy the same week.

### Outcomes

- A written **Leadership Standard** you can teach to your team and your family.  
- A **90-day plan** with weekly reviews and a cadence you can keep.  
- A **communication script** for hard moments (brief, precise, fair).

# Governance

In the context of the **Institutional Governance** brief, Governance refers to the protocols, processes, and link-integrity checks that ensure all 75 intelligence briefs remain verified and accessible.

## Core Pillars
1. **Link-Integrity:** The prevention of 404 errors through systematic routing.
2. **Sovereign Oversight:** Manual and AI-augmented vetting of content.
3. **Vault Security:** Hardened exclusion of binary artifacts from the build scan.

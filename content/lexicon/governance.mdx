# Governance

{"Governance is not 'management'; management is about efficiency, but governance is about alignment."}

In the Canon, **Governance** is the immune system of an institution. It is the set of protocols that prevents "Strategic Drift." It requires the courage to enforce constraints and the discipline to maintain rhythms even when they feel repetitive.



### The Three Layers of Governance

1.  **Self-Governance**: The ability to regulate one's own appetites, emotions, and time. This is the prerequisite for all other forms of authority.
2.  **Domestic Governance**: The ordering of the household (roles, rituals, finances) to create a "stable floor" for future generations.
3.  **Institutional Governance**: The formal structures (boards, agendas, ledgers) that protect a mission from the ego of its leaders.

> {"\"Authority is the right to rule; Governance is the skill of maintaining that rule.\""}

# Responsibility

{"Responsibility is the currency of maturity. You are as 'adult' as the weight you are willing to carry without complaining."}

Modern culture views responsibility as a burden to be minimized. The Canon views it as the **mechanism of expansion**. You do not get more authority so that you can have less responsibility; you accept more responsibility so that you are trusted with more authority.



### The Logic of Responsibility

* **Accountability**: The willingness to be measured against a standard.
* **Ownership**: Treating a problem as your own, regardless of who caused it.
* **The Weight Test**: A leader is measured by how much "chaos" they can hold and convert into "order" before they fracture.

# Integrity

{"Integrity is not just 'honesty'; it is structural soundness."}

In engineering, a bridge has integrity when it can support its intended load without collapsing. In the Canon, a person has **Integrity** when their private character can support the weight of their public office.



### The Components of Integrity

1.  **Consistency**: Acting the same way in the dark as you do in the light.
2.  **Wholeness**: The absence of "compartmentalization." You are the same person in the Strategy Room as you are at the family table.
3.  **Alignment**: The bridge between *Purpose* and *Proof*. If you say your purpose is "X" but your proof is "Y," you have a fracture in your integrity.

# Integrity

**Integrity** is the state of being whole and undivided. In strategic terms, it is the elimination of the "gap" between what an institution claims to be and what it actually produces.

## Core Pillars
* **Consistency**: Reliability across time and pressure.
* **Alignment**: Vertical integration of vision and action.
* **Transparency**: The ability for the internal structure to withstand external scrutiny.

### Why this matters for your next build:
1.  **Validator Success**: Once you save these, the `validate-links.mjs` will find these slugs in the `allDocuments` array. They will no longer be "white-listed" exceptions; they will be **verified internal briefs**.
2.  **Glossary Power**: You can now add "Sovereignty" and "Integrity" to your `glossary.json`. The `glossary-injector.mjs` will then automatically scan all 163 briefs and link every mention of these words back to these new definitions.

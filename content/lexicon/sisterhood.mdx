# [Sisterhood](/lexicon/sisterhood)

{"Sisterhood is the internal architecture of civilisational health. It is the guild that ensures the Lore is lived before it is lectured."}

In the Abraham of London framework, we reject the modern "social" sisterhood defined by comparison, gossip, or shared victimhood. The Canon defines **Sisterhood** as the collective of women who safeguard the **Atmosphere of the Restoration**. While the [Brotherhood](/lexicon/brotherhood) builds the walls and defends the gates, the Sisterhood ensures that what is inside those walls is worth defending.



## The Three Mandates of the Sisterhood

### 1. Cultural Transmission (The Living Lore)
The Sisterhood is the primary curator of the rhythms, rituals, and aesthetics that form the hearts of the next generation. They convert the abstract principles of the [Legacy](/lexicon/legacy) into the tangible reality of the home. They are the "Institutional Memory" of how a family feels, eats, prays, and recovers.

### 2. The Discernment Filter
A sovereign Sisterhood provides the intuitive regulation that prevents the Brotherhood from becoming brittle, mechanical, or purely transactional. They possess the "Soft Governance" required to identify hidden fractures in trust or character before they become structural failures.

### 3. Hospitality Governance (Gatekeeping the Hearth)
The Sisterhood manages the "Sacred Space." They decide who is permitted into the inner circle of the family’s life and who remains at the gate. By controlling the environment of the [Oikos](/lexicon/family), they protect the formation of the children from external narrative contamination.

## The Sisterhood Mandate

{"\"A civilisation is only as strong as the women who refuse to let the fire of the hearth go out.\""}

A man may build a house, but it is the Sisterhood that builds the **Home**. Without this guild, the Great Restoration is merely a political or economic project. With it, it becomes a living culture that people will die to preserve.

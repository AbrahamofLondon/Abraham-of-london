# Sovereignty

In the context of the Abraham of London vault, **Sovereignty** is defined as the ultimate right to exercise authority over a domain.

## Dual Nature
1. **Divine Sovereignty**: The foundational belief that ultimate governance rests outside human systems.
2. **Individual Sovereignty**: The delegated responsibility of the individual to govern their own character, choices, and household.

&gt; "Sovereignty is not the absence of influence, but the presence of absolute responsibility."

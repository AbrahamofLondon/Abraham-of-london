# [Sovereignty](/lexicon/sovereignty)

In the context of the Abraham of London vault, **[Sovereignty](/lexicon/sovereignty)** is defined as the ultimate right to exercise authority over a domain.

## Dual Nature
1. **Divine [Sovereignty](/lexicon/sovereignty)**: The foundational belief that ultimate governance rests outside human systems.
2. **Individual [Sovereignty](/lexicon/sovereignty)**: The delegated responsibility of the individual to govern their own character and household.

> "[Sovereignty](/lexicon/sovereignty) is not the absence of influence, but the presence of absolute responsibility."

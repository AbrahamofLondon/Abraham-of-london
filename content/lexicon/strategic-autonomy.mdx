# [Strategic Autonomy](/lexicon/strategic-autonomy)

**[Strategic Autonomy](/lexicon/strategic-autonomy)** is the capacity of an individual or institution to set objectives and pursue them without being functionally dependent on external actors who do not share the same values or vision.

## The Three Pillars of Autonomy

1. **Resource Independence**: Ensuring that the "fuel" for the mission (capital, data, or energy) is not controlled by hostile or volatile gatekeepers.
2. **Cognitive [Sovereignty](/lexicon/sovereignty)**: The ability to process information and make decisions based on first principles rather than manufactured social consensus.
3. **Systemic Resilience**: Building internal structures that can withstand the withdrawal of external support systems.

&gt; "Autonomy is not isolation; it is the ability to choose your partnerships from a position of strength rather than a position of necessity."

## Application in the Vault
Within this portfolio, [Strategic Autonomy](/lexicon/strategic-autonomy) is treated as the prerequisite for **[Institutional Integrity](/lexicon/integrity)**. Without the power to say 'No' to misaligned resources, an institution cannot maintain its 'Yes' to its primary mission.

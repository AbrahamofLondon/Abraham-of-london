# Entrepreneur Operating Pack

A pragmatic toolkit for founders who prefer execution over theatrics. Use this pack to create clarity, protect cadence, and make cash last longer.

## What’s Inside

- **30•60•90 Priorities Board** – one page, three horizons.
- **Weekly Review Sheet** – metrics, cash, decisions, blockers.
- **Decision Log** – date, owner, rationale, expected results.
- **Cash Compass** – receipts, commitments, runway view.

## How to Use It

1. **Set the standard** – write the operating principles at the top of each template.
2. **Schedule the rhythm** – add weekly and monthly reviews to your calendar.
3. **Record reality** – no posturing; enter data as it is.
4. **Decide, then ship** – note decisions, set owners, and move.

> Stewardship beats spectacle. The scoreboard is cash, customers, and credibility.

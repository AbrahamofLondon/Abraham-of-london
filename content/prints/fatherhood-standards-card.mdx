# Fatherhood Standards Card

Standards keep the house steady when storms arrive. Print, laminate, and place where it’s seen daily.

## The Standards

- **Presence over performance** – show up, especially when it’s inconvenient.
- **Order first** – Scripture, schedule, sleep.
- **Truth + kindness** – correct without contempt.
- **Steady tone** – no shouting, ever.
- **Repair quickly** – apologise without qualifiers.

## Weekly Rhythm

- **1:1 Time** – 30 minutes of undistracted conversation.
- **Sabbath meal** – phones away; blessings spoken.
- **Service** – one task done together for someone else.

> A father’s consistency becomes a child’s confidence.

# Fatherhood Standards Card

Standards keep the house steady when storms arrive. Print, laminate, and place where it's seen daily.

## The Standards

- **Presence over performance** - show up, especially when it's inconvenient.
- **Order first** - Scripture, schedule, sleep.
- **Truth + kindness** - correct without contempt.
- **Steady tone** - no shouting, ever.
- **Repair quickly** - apologise without qualifiers.

## Weekly Rhythm

- **1:1 Time** - 30 minutes of undistracted conversation.
- **Sabbath meal** - phones away; blessings spoken.
- **Service** - one task done together for someone else.

&gt; A father's consistency becomes a child's confidence.

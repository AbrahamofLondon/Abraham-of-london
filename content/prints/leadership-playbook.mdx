# Leadership Playbook (30•60•90)

Enter any team with clarity and leave them stronger than you met them.

## 0–30 Days: Listen & Map

- Mandate, constraints, and non-negotiables.
- People map: owners, influencers, resistors.
- Baseline: cash, risk, KPIs, delivery backlog.

## 31–60 Days: Stabilise & Prove

- Set the **Operating Rhythm** (weekly reviews, decision forum).
- Pilot two visible fixes; publish the results.
- Remove one systemic blocker.

## 61–90 Days: Scale & Guard

- Institutionalise the wins (policies, templates, training).
- Set 12-week targets tied to cash and risk.
- Guard standards—document and enforce.

> Cadence builds culture. Culture sustains outcomes.

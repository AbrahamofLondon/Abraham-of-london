# Mentorship Starter Kit

[Clarity](/lexicon/clarity), boundaries, and a rhythm that respects time.

## Setup

- **[Purpose](/lexicon/purpose):** 1-2 sentences on the mentee's desired outcomes.
- **Scope:** topics allowed; topics off-limits.
- **Cadence:** 45 minutes bi-weekly; async check-ins allowed.

## Session Template

1. Wins (5m)
2. Blockers (10m)
3. Decisions (15m)
4. Commitments (10m)
5. Review next steps (5m)

## Rules of Engagement

- Confidentiality is standard.
- Homework is mandatory.
- Progress is recorded, not performed.

&gt; Mentoring is stewardship: transfer wisdom, not dependency.

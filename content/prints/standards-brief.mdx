# Standards Brief

This is the one-pager leaders hand to new joiners and partners.

## Non-Negotiables

- **Truth in reporting** - we write what is, not what flatters.
- **Decisions have owners** - one name, one date, one result.
- **Calm is policy** - urgency without panic.
- **Privacy by default** - we don't trade optics for trust.

## Review & Enforcement

- Weekly cadence check (15 minutes).
- Monthly standard audit (evidence of adherence).
- Breaches documented; remediation assigned.

> Standards are cheaper than rework. Guard them.

# Weekly Operating Rhythm

A boring, repeatable loop that compounds.

## Weekly Loop

- **Mon - Plan:** priorities, capacity, risks (30m).
- **Wed - Review:** metrics, blockers, decisions (20m).
- **Fri - Close:** shipped work, learnings, next week's seed (15m).

## Artefacts

- **Board:** Now / Next / Later (three columns only).
- **Metrics:** 3-5 signals tied to value and risk.
- **Decision Log:** date, owner, rationale, effect.

## Guardrails

- Meetings start on time; end early.
- Async first; meetings only for decisions.
- No stealth work-everything visible on the board.

> Rhythm beats intensity. Keep it simple, keep it weekly.

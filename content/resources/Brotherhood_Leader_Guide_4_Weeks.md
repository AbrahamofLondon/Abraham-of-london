# Brotherhood Leader Guide — First 4 Weeks

**Outcome:** A small band of present men living the Brotherhood Code with predictable rhythm.

---

## Week 1 — SEED (60 minutes)
**Goal:** Frame purpose, agree the Code, set rhythm.

- Opening (5): welcome + purpose + prayer
- Scripture (15): Matthew 5:1–12 — each man shares one line: “What strikes me?”
- Formation (20): Habit audit — sleep, Scripture, sweat, sunlight, support → pick ONE micro‑habit
- Commitments (10): one concrete step + deadline (Fri)
- Intercession (10): pray names and needs; text one person before leaving

**Between weeks:** Convener sends summary + reminders.

---

## Week 2 — FRAME (75–90 minutes)
**Goal:** Put bones on the body.

- Read the **Code** aloud; each man signs the one‑page covenant
- Scripture track: Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5–7)
- Formation track: Habits & Money (budget basics + one saving/cutting action)
- Roles: assign convener/timekeeper/scribe/chaplain (rotate monthly)

**Deliverable:** Shared calendar invite + location + start/stop times.

---

## Week 3 — FORGE (90 minutes)
**Goal:** Practice the accountability stack without shame.

- Scripture (30): Matthew 5:13–30 (salt/light; anger; integrity)
- Formation (30): Phone discipline (notifications off blocks; “Scripture before screen”)
- Accountability (20): run the **Facts / Heart / Hope** stack in pairs
- Intercession (10)

**Guardrails:** brief shares; clear actions; follow‑up next week.

---

## Week 4 — FLOW (90 minutes)
**Goal:** Cement cadence; do one thing together.

- Scripture (30): Matthew 5:31–48 (faithfulness; enemy‑love)
- Formation (20): Money check‑in + one generosity act
- Serve (20): choose a simple act (deliver a meal / check on a dad)
- Intercession (10)
- Calendar (10): confirm next month’s host + rotation

# Fathers in Family Court — Practical Pack

**Purpose:** Equip fathers to present truth with clarity and integrity. This is not legal advice.

---

## 1) Evidence Checklist — “Receipts or it didn’t happen”
- **Time & Communication:** dates, times, channels, missed/shortened contact, refusals.
- **Parenting Involvement:** homework help, school runs, parent evenings, medical appointments.
- **Financial Support:** bank statements, receipts, transfers, reference notes.
- **Third-Party Notes:** teacher/coach confirmations, church leaders, childminders.
- **Interference / Obstruction:** late cancellations, withheld info, contradictory statements (facts only).
- **File Hygiene:** one cloud folder; filenames like `YYYY-MM-DD_topic.ext`.

---

## 2) Court-Prep Checklist (48–72 hours before)
- Confirm hearing details: time, court, judge (if known), room, remote link.
- Compile **bundle** (or your organised pack): order, paginate, table of contents.
- Print/prepare **3 copies** of key exhibits (you, other side, court).
- Draft **3 headline points** tied to *best interests of the child*.
- Outfit ready (smart, neutral), travel plan + buffer, childcare cover.
- Tech check for remote hearings (quiet space, headphones, battery).

---

## 3) “B.P.F.” Rule for Communications
- **Brief** — keep to the point; 4–6 sentences max.
- **Polite** — neutral tone; no blame adjectives.
- **Factual** — who/what/when/where; a single clear *ask* with deadline.

**Template (after missed contact):**
> “At 18:40 on 12/10, pick-up at Elm Street did not occur. I waited until 19:05.
> I propose alternatives this week: Wed 18:00 or Fri 18:00 at the same location.
> Please confirm by 12:00 tomorrow which you prefer.”

---

## 4) Witness & Community Support
- Ask teachers/coaches for **short factual notes**: attendance, punctuality, engagement.
- Line up a **character reference** (work/faith leader) — 1 page, facts + examples.
- Keep supporters off social media commentary; they harm more than help.

---

## 5) Online & Messaging Hygiene
- No late-night texts; no rants; no diagnosing the other party.
- Turn off read-receipts if it fuels conflict. Screenshot important threads.
- Never post case details online. Assume all messages will be read in court.

---

## 6) Day-of-Court Grounding (5 minutes)
- Box breathing $4\times4\times4\times4$ for 1 minute.
- Prayer (choose one):
  - “Jesus, carry me — I choose trust.”
  - “Set a guard over my mouth; give me mercy and steel.”
- Repeat your **3 headline points** out loud.
- Decide your “one ask” today (specific, child-focused).

---

## 7) Sample Letter — Factual, Child-First
To Whom It May Concern,

I am the father of [Child’s Name, DOB]. I am writing to provide a brief factual summary relevant to contact arrangements.

- I have attended [list key school/medical events] between [dates].
- I provide [weekly/fortnightly] financial support of [amount]; evidence attached.
- Contact has occurred on [X of Y scheduled occasions] over the last [period].
- On [dates], contact did not occur due to [brief factual reason if known].

**Request:** I propose the following contact pattern in the child’s best interests:
- [e.g., Wednesday 17:00–19:00 handover at X; Saturday 10:00–14:00 at Y]
I am available to adjust logistics to support schooling, rest, and routine.

Sincerely,
[Name] — [Phone] — [Email]

---

## 8) Post-Hearing Debrief (that evening)
- Write 10 lines: outcomes, deadlines, next steps, emotions (for processing only).
- Email yourself the note; add tasks to calendar.
- Do one act of presence for your child: read, call, record a 60-second voice note.

**Remember:** Court rewards clarity. Children thrive on consistency. Your job is both.

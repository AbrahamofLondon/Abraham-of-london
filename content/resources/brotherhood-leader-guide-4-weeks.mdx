- Deliverable: agree the **one** weekly slot

### Week 2 Ã¢â‚¬â€ Truth & Confession
- Frame: _facts Ã¢â€ â€™ feelings Ã¢â€ â€™ forward_
- Practice: 2-minute confession; no fixing
- Deliverable: one micro-habit for 7 days

### Week 3 Ã¢â‚¬â€ Service & Households
- Practice: pick one burden to lift this week
- Deliverable: a **date & person** to help

### Week 4 Ã¢â‚¬â€ Review & Renew

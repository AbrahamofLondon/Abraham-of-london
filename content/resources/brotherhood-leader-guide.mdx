## V. [Leadership](/lexicon/leadership) Development
### The Participant-to-Leader Pipeline

<BriefAlert title="MULTIPLICATION MANDATE" level="success" icon="🌱">
Your success is not measured by how long you lead — but by how many leaders you form.
</BriefAlert>

### The Five-Stage Progression

<Callout type="note" title="Operational Principle">
This pipeline is **not** a ladder for status. It is a framework for stewardship:
**character first**, **competence second**, **commissioning last**.
</Callout>

<LeadershipPipeline>
  <Stage data-number="1" title="Participant" duration="Months 1–6">
    **Role**: Fully engaged member building trust and learning rhythms.  
    **Criteria**: Zero unexcused absences; taken the Hot Seat at least once; practices confidentiality without exception.
  </Stage>

  <Stage data-number="2" title="Contributor" duration="Months 7–12">
    **Role**: Active contributor offering wisdom and modeling vulnerability.  
    **Criteria**: Others seek his counsel; can hold tension without rushing to “fix”; speaks with clarity and restraint.
  </Stage>

  <Stage data-number="3" title="Facilitator-in-Training" duration="Months 13–18">
    **Role**: Learning to facilitate segments under supervision — tone, time, and truth.  
    **Criteria**: Can facilitate a full 90-minute meeting competently; handles conflict without panic or domination.
  </Stage>

  <Stage data-number="4" title="Co-Leader" duration="Months 19–24">
    **Role**: Co-facilitating meetings, onboarding new brothers, and executing decisions.  
    **Criteria**: The group functions equally well under his leadership; he protects the standard without becoming harsh.
  </Stage>

  <Stage data-number="5" title="Planting Leader" duration="Month 25+">
    **Role**: Ready to take 2–3 brothers and start a new Table of Five.  
    **Commissioning**: A formal sendoff ceremony — blessing, accountability, and a clear charter for the new table.
  </Stage>
</LeadershipPipeline>

### The [Leadership](/lexicon/leadership) Conversation Script

<Callout type="info" title="Conversation Script">
**Leader**: *“I’ve been watching you. I see leadership capacity in you — and I want to develop it with precision. I’d like to train you to facilitate, then to plant your own Table in time. This is a 12–18 month process. What questions do you have — and what would make you hesitate?”*
</Callout>

<Callout type="note" title="Leader Note">
Do not recruit with flattery. Recruit with **clarity**.  
Make the cost visible. Make the standards explicit. Make the end-state noble.
</Callout>

## VII. Leader Self-Care
### The Oxygen Mask Principle

<BriefAlert title="NON-NEGOTIABLE" level="warn" icon="⚠️">
You cannot pour from an empty cup. Leadership without self-care becomes drift, then burnout, then failure.
</BriefAlert>

<PillarGrid>
  <Pillar icon="🧘" title="Spiritual Health">
    Personal prayer/meditation practice — consistent, not occasional.
  </Pillar>

  <Pillar icon="💪" title="Physical Health">
    Sleep and training rhythms — disciplined, not reactive.
  </Pillar>

  <Pillar icon="💑" title="Relational Health">
    Marriage is primary; date nights protected; conflict handled promptly.
  </Pillar>

  <Pillar icon="🎯" title="Vocational Health">
    Work-life boundaries enforced; integrity kept; pace governed.
  </Pillar>
</PillarGrid>

<Callout type="success" title="Stewardship">
**This is my stewardship. This is my mandate.**
</Callout>

## VIII. The Leader's Creed

<Creed>

**I am not a guru. I am a guide.**
I do not have all the answers, but I will ask the questions that lead men to find them.

**I am not perfect. I am present.**
I will not pretend to be beyond struggle, but I will show up consistently.

**I am not a dictator. I am a steward.**
This group is not mine to control. It is mine to protect and multiply.

**I will challenge without crushing.**
I will speak truth, but I will not wield it as a weapon.

**I will lead by going first.**
In vulnerability, in accountability, in growth--I will model what I ask.

**I will remember: this is holy work.**
When men gather in pursuit of truth and legacy--God is present.

---

**This is my stewardship. This is my mandate.**

</Creed>

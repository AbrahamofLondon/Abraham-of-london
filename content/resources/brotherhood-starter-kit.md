## Getting Started

1. **Define Your Brotherhood** - What values will guide your relationships?

3. **Create Accountability Structures** - How will you support each other's growth?
4. **Build Rituals** - What regular practices will strengthen your bonds?

## Core Principles

- **Authenticity over Performance** - Show up as you are, not as you think you should be
- **Vulnerability with Boundaries** - Share deeply while respecting privacy
- **Consistency over Intensity** - Small, regular connections build stronger bonds
- **Service over Status** - Focus on how you can serve, not what you can get

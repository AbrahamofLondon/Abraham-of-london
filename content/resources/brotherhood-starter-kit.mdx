What is said at the table stays at the table. Period. No exceptions except for immediate danger to self or others.
</Rule>
<Rule title="Zero Judgment, Total Accountability" icon="🤝">
We accept the man as he is, but we do not allow him to stay in his weakness. We speak the truth in love.
</Rule>
<Rule title="The No-Ghosting Rule" icon="📅">
Consistency is the currency of trust. 24-hour notice for any absence. 3 strikes and the seat is vacated.
</Rule>
<Rule title="[Legacy](/lexicon/legacy) Mindset" icon="🌳">
We are not here to vent; we are here to build. Every session must result in action that strengthens the home or business.
</Rule>

# Canon Builder's Rule of Life

You cannot build something that endures on a life that is drifting.
The Canon assumes that serious builders live by **rule**, not by impulse.

This framework is not a legalistic checklist. It is a **trellis**-a structure that allows life to grow in the right direction.






## 2. Daily Standards for Speech, Money, and Eyes

Canon builders set explicit daily lines:

- **Speech**

  - No gossip, no flattery, no needless complaint.
  - If you must confront, do it privately and directly.

- **Money**

  - Track every outgoing.
  - Tithe and generosity are pre-decided, not mood-driven.

- **Eyes**
  - No pornography. No lingering on images designed to inflame lust or covetousness.
  - Practise "bounce and bless": look away, pray a short blessing instead.

Write these into your rule. Review at night without excuses.






## 4. Monthly Examination & Course Correction

Once a month, carve out **2-3 hours** alone.

Work through:

1. **Canon Alignment Questions**

   - Am I living as a **builder** or a **critic**?
   - Have I drifted into self-pity, entitlement, or cynicism?
   - Is my household becoming more ordered or more chaotic?

2. **Confession & Repentance**

   - Name specific sins and patterns.
   - Ask for cleansing and fresh wisdom.

3. **Re-commitment of Call**
   - Re-state, in writing, the call you believe God has placed on your life.
   - Adjust if necessary as light increases.






## 6. Guarding Against Extremes

Two ditches threaten every rule of life:

1. **Legalism** - trusting the rule instead of the Lord.
2. **Licence** - abandoning the rule when it exposes your flesh.

The Canon path is different:

- Use the rule as a **tool**, not an identity.
- When you fail, **repent and resume**, not abandon.
- Let trusted people **see and challenge** your rule regularly.

&gt; Builders are not defined by how often they never fall,
&gt; but by how quickly they rise, repent, and rebuild.

Write your rule. Live your rule.
Then, when the storm comes, you will not discover who you are; you will simply reveal what you have been practising all along.

# Canon Builder’s Rule of Life  

You cannot build something that endures on a life that is drifting.  
The Canon assumes that serious builders live by **rule**, not by impulse.

This framework is not a legalistic checklist. It is a **trellis**—a structure that allows life to grow in the right direction.

## 1. Non-Negotiable Morning Anchor (30–60 minutes)

Every day begins before you touch your phone.

**Components:**

1. **Stillness (3–5 minutes)**  
   - Sit. Breathe. Acknowledge God’s presence.  
   - Pray: “Speak, Lord; your servant is listening.”

2. **Scripture (10–20 minutes)**  
   - Follow a reading plan that ties into the Canon Year One plan.  
   - Read slowly. Mark verbs and commands.

3. **Canon Paragraph (3–5 minutes)**  
   - Read one paragraph from any Canon volume or resource.  
   - Ask: *“If I live this today, what changes?”*

4. **Intercession (10–15 minutes)**  
   - Pray by **domains**:
     - Heart (character and affections)  
     - House (family and household)  
     - Hand (work and vocation)  
     - Horizon (city, nation, Church)

Record one sentence in a notebook:  

> “Today, obedience looks like _______________________.”

## 2. Daily Standards for Speech, Money, and Eyes

Canon builders set explicit daily lines:

- **Speech**  
  - No gossip, no flattery, no needless complaint.  
  - If you must confront, do it privately and directly.

- **Money**  
  - Track every outgoing.  
  - Tithe and generosity are pre-decided, not mood-driven.  

- **Eyes**  
  - No pornography. No lingering on images designed to inflame lust or covetousness.  
  - Practise “bounce and bless”: look away, pray a short blessing instead.

Write these into your rule. Review at night without excuses.

## 3. Weekly Canon Builder Rhythm

**Sabbath Block (Half or Full Day):**

- Cease from ordinary work.  
- Engage in worship, rest, and relationships.  
- Review the week:
  - Where did you obey quickly?  
  - Where did you compromise?  

**Stewardship Block (60–90 minutes):**

- Review:
  - Calendar for the coming week  
  - Finances and giving  
  - Commitments to people (mentoring, family, team)  

Ask:

1. *What must be honoured?*  
2. *What must be cancelled or delegated?*  
3. *What must be started?*

---

## 4. Monthly Examination & Course Correction

Once a month, carve out **2–3 hours** alone.

Work through:

1. **Canon Alignment Questions**
   - Am I living as a **builder** or a **critic**?  
   - Have I drifted into self-pity, entitlement, or cynicism?  
   - Is my household becoming more ordered or more chaotic?

2. **Confession & Repentance**
   - Name specific sins and patterns.  
   - Ask for cleansing and fresh wisdom.

3. **Re-commitment of Call**
   - Re-state, in writing, the call you believe God has placed on your life.  
   - Adjust if necessary as light increases.

## 6. Guarding Against Extremes

Two ditches threaten every rule of life:

1. **Legalism** – trusting the rule instead of the Lord.  
2. **Licence** – abandoning the rule when it exposes your flesh.

The Canon path is different:

- Use the rule as a **tool**, not an identity.  
- When you fail, **repent and resume**, not abandon.  
- Let trusted people **see and challenge** your rule regularly.

> Builders are not defined by how often they never fall,  
> but by how quickly they rise, repent, and rebuild.

Write your rule. Live your rule.  
Then, when the storm comes, you will not discover who you are; you will simply reveal what you have been practising all along.

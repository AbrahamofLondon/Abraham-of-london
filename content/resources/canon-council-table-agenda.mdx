# Council Table Agenda - Canon Leadership Session

The Canon assumes that serious work is done at **tables**-where elders, founders, and builders gather with fear of the Lord and clarity of mandate.

This agenda is designed for:

- Church elder boards
- Business leadership teams
- Non-profit boards
- Family councils overseeing multi-household decisions

Use it as a standing template. **Do not** add items lightly. Every extra item is an assault on focus.



{/* stripped: duplicate frontmatter block */}


## 1. Opening (10-15 minutes)

**1.1 Call to Order**

- Start **on time**. Entrance is governance.
- State the primary **mandate** for the meeting in one sentence.

**1.2 Scripture & Silence**

- Read a short passage relevant to your decisions (e.g., Proverbs 11, Acts 6, James 3).
- Observe **2 minutes of silence**. Let hearts settle.

**1.3 Roll Call & Roles**

- Confirm who is present.
- Identify:
  - Chair
  - Scribe / Minute-taker
  - Timekeeper

## 3. Strategic Agenda Items (60-90 minutes)

For each strategic item:

1. **Name the Issue** (max 3 minutes)

   - "We are deciding whether to..." not "We are discussing..."

2. **Clarify the Stakes** (max 5 minutes)

   - Who will be affected?
   - What could be lost?
   - What covenant, law, or value is at risk?

3. **Hear the Data** (max 10 minutes)

   - Facts, not speculation.
   - Short written summary, not slides bloat.

4. **Council Deliberation** (15-20 minutes)

   - Chair ensures:
     - Everyone speaks once before anyone speaks twice.
     - No one dominates by volume or rank.
     - Scripture, Canon principles, and history are allowed to speak.

5. **Decision & Owner** (5 minutes)
   - Clear "Yes / No / Not yet".
   - Single named owner.
   - Deadline.
   - Conditions or guardrails.

Record decisions in writing **in the room**, not "later."



{/* stripped: duplicate frontmatter block */}


## 5. People & Formation (10-15 minutes)

Canon councils are responsible not only for decisions but for **souls**.

- Who is carrying unusual weight or pressure right now?
- Where do we see grace at work that needs to be named and encouraged?
- Are there hidden fractures in trust that must be addressed privately?

Agree on **one concrete act of care** to take this week.

---

## 6. Summary, Prayer, and Dismissal (10 minutes)

- Chair or scribe reads back:

  - Key decisions
  - Owners and deadlines

- Close in prayer:
  - Thanksgiving for guidance
  - Request for protection from pride, fear, and flattery
  - Blessing over those affected by your decisions

End **on time**. Predictability is part of honour.

> **Canon Principle:** Meetings are not for performance.
> They are for aligning power, responsibility, and obedience.

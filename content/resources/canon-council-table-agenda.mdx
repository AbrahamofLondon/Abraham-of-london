# Council Table Agenda

{"The Canon assumes that serious work is done at tables—where elders, founders, and builders gather with clarity of mandate."}



## I. Opening (15 minutes)

1.  **Call to Order**: Start on time. Entrance is an act of governance.
2.  **The Mandate**: State the primary objective of this specific session in one sentence.
3.  **Silence**: Observe 2 minutes of silence. Let hearts settle before the ego speaks.
4.  **Roll Call**: Assign the roles of Chair, Scribe, and Timekeeper.

---

## II. Strategic Deliberation (60-90 minutes)

For every agenda item, follow this rigorous flow:

1.  **Name the Issue**: {"\"We are deciding whether to...\""} (Never "We are discussing...")
2.  **Clarify the Stakes**: What value or covenant is at risk?
3.  **Hear the Data**: Facts only. No slides—use short written summaries.
4.  **Council Deliberation**: Everyone speaks once before anyone speaks twice. Ensure Scripture and history are heard.
5.  **The Decision**: Clear "Yes / No / Not Yet" recorded in the room. Assign a single named owner.

---

## III. People & Formation

Canon councils are responsible for **souls**, not just spreadsheets.
* Identify who is carrying unusual weight.
* Address fractures in trust privately.
* Agree on **one concrete act of care** for the coming week.

<Note tone="key" title="Governance Standard">
  **Meetings are not for performance.** They are for aligning power, responsibility, and obedience. End on time. Predictability is part of honour.

# Canon Household Charter

> _"As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord."_ - Joshua 24:15

Civilisations rise or fall on what happens in ordinary homes.  
This charter template exists so your household is not governed by the loudest mood, the most demanding child, or the latest cultural trend-but by conscious, written covenant.

Use it as:

- A **drafting framework** for your own family charter.
- A **teaching tool** for walking children into shared responsibility.
- A **plumb line** to review annually and tighten as standards rise.

## Section 1 - Foundational Confession

**1.1 Name of Household**

> _"We, the household of **\*\*\*\***\_\_\_\_**\*\*\*\***, located in **\*\*\*\***\_\_\_\_**\*\*\*\***, make this confession..."_

**1.2 Ultimate Allegiance**

We confess that:

1. Our first allegiance is to the **Lord Jesus Christ**, not to career, comfort, or culture.
2. Our home exists to **host His presence**, **form character**, and **prepare builders** for His purposes.
3. Every resource entrusted to us-time, money, influence, gifts-belongs to Him.

You may add a short family creed here (3-7 lines). Keep it repeatable; children should be able to learn it by heart.

---

## Section 2 - Roles & Stewardships

Instead of fuzzy expectations, the Canon insists on **clear offices** in the home:

- **Head of Household** - responsible before God for direction, doctrine, and discipline.
- **Keeper of the Hearth** - responsible for atmosphere, hospitality, and daily rhythm.
- **Sons & Daughters** - responsible for honour, growth, and stewardship of gifts.

### 2.1 Role Statements

For each role, complete:

- _Authority I carry_
- _Responsibilities I accept_
- _Limits I will not cross_
- _People I am accountable to_

Example (Head of Household):

- I will **lead by example**, not by volume.
- I will set the **financial direction**, but we will make major decisions in counsel.
- I will not use Scripture as a weapon to excuse laziness, harshness, or irresponsibility.

---

## Section 3 - Standards & Boundaries

Canon homes are not governed by vibes; they are governed by **standards**.

### 3.1 Non-Negotiable Standards

Agree and write down **5-10 non-negotiables**, for example:

- We speak to one another with honour-no sarcasm, no contempt.
- Screens never outrank people at the table.
- We do not lie, ever, even "for peace."
- We resolve conflict before we sleep, as far as it depends on us.

### 3.2 Boundaries with Culture

Clarify:

- **What we will not bring into this house** (content, practices, relationships).
- **What we will actively cultivate** (books, conversations, guests, service).

---

## Section 4 - Rhythms & Rituals

Write down your core rhythms:

- **Daily** - prayer, Scripture, shared meal, review of the day.
- **Weekly** - family altar; review of schedule and finances; hospitality.
- **Monthly** - extended conversation about purpose, gifts, and progress.
- **Annually** - family retreat; review and revision of this charter.

You are not aiming for performance. You are aiming for **predictable formation**.

---

## Section 5 - Discipline & Restoration

Canon homes do not outsource discipline to schools, police, or social media shame.

Define:

1. **What counts as serious breach** (disrespect, deceit, violence, etc.).
2. **What discipline looks like** (loss of privileges, restitution, increased responsibility).
3. **What restoration requires**:
   - Honest confession
   - Clear ownership of harm done
   - Concrete act of restitution
   - Blessing and reinstatement

The goal is not punishment. The goal is **restored trust and strengthened character**.

---

## Section 6 - Covenant & Signatures

> _"We enter this charter freely, with understanding, and in the fear of the Lord."_

- Head of Household: ****\*\*****\_\_****\*\***** Date: \***\*\_\_\*\***
- Keeper of the Hearth: **\*\*\*\***\_\_\_\_**\*\*\*\*** Date: \***\*\_\_\*\***
- Sons / Daughters (age-appropriate): **\_\_\_** Date: \***\*\_\_\*\***

Review and resign yearly.  
You are not just raising children-you are building a civilisation.  
Write like it. Live like it.

# Canon Household Charter

&gt; _"As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord."_ - Joshua 24:15

Civilisations rise or fall on what happens in ordinary homes.
This charter template exists so your household is not governed by the loudest mood, the most demanding child, or the latest cultural trend-but by conscious, written covenant.

Use it as:

- A **drafting framework** for your own family charter.
- A **teaching tool** for walking children into shared responsibility.
- A **plumb line** to review annually and tighten as standards rise.

## Section 2 - Roles & Stewardships

Instead of fuzzy expectations, the Canon insists on **clear offices** in the home:

- **Head of Household** - responsible before God for direction, doctrine, and discipline.
- **Keeper of the Hearth** - responsible for atmosphere, hospitality, and daily rhythm.
- **Sons & Daughters** - responsible for honour, growth, and stewardship of gifts.

### 2.1 Role Statements

For each role, complete:

- _Authority I carry_
- _Responsibilities I accept_
- _Limits I will not cross_
- _People I am accountable to_

Example (Head of Household):

- I will **lead by example**, not by volume.
- I will set the **financial direction**, but we will make major decisions in counsel.
- I will not use Scripture as a weapon to excuse laziness, harshness, or irresponsibility.



{/* stripped: duplicate frontmatter block */}


## Section 4 - Rhythms & Rituals

Write down your core rhythms:

- **Daily** - prayer, Scripture, shared meal, review of the day.
- **Weekly** - family altar; review of schedule and finances; hospitality.
- **Monthly** - extended conversation about purpose, gifts, and progress.
- **Annually** - family retreat; review and revision of this charter.

You are not aiming for performance. You are aiming for **predictable formation**.

## Section 6 - Covenant & Signatures

&gt; _"We enter this charter freely, with understanding, and in the fear of the Lord."_

- Head of Household: ****\*\*****\_\_****\*\***** Date: \***\*\_\_\*\***
- Keeper of the Hearth: **\*\*\*\***\_\_\_\_**\*\*\*\*** Date: \***\*\_\_\*\***
- Sons / Daughters (age-appropriate): **\_\_\_** Date: \***\*\_\_\*\***

Review and resign yearly.
You are not just raising children-you are building a civilisation.
Write like it. Live like it.

## I. Roles & Stewardships

The Canon insists on **clear offices** to prevent resentment and ambiguity.

* **Head of Household**: Responsible for direction, doctrine, and discipline.
* **Keeper of the Hearth**: Responsible for atmosphere, hospitality, and daily rhythm.
* **Sons & Daughters**: Responsible for honour, growth, and stewardship of gifts.



### 1.1 The Role Audit
For each role, define:
* *Authority I carry*
* *Responsibilities I accept*
* *Limits I will not cross*

## II. Rhythms & Rituals

Predictable formation beats occasional inspiration. Define your family's heartbeat:

* **Daily**: Shared meals, evening reviews, or prayer.
* **Weekly**: The "Family Altar"—reviewing the week's finances and schedule.
* **Monthly**: Deep conversations on purpose and individual progress.
* **Annually**: A family retreat to review and resign this Charter.

## III. Covenant & Signatures

&gt; {"\"We enter this charter freely, with understanding, and in the fear of the Lord.\""}

This is the point of accountability. Signing the charter transforms it from a "good idea" into a binding family law. Review and re-sign annually to reflect the growth of the household.

# Canon Reading Plan - Year One

## Why a Reading Plan?

The Canon is not designed to be skimmed like a blog feed. It is an architecture.  
Architectures are absorbed slowly, with tension, until they rewire how you see the world.

This Year One plan exists for three reasons:

1. **Pace** - so you are never overwhelmed, but never idle.
2. **Retention** - so key patterns lodge in memory and language.
3. **Obedience** - so reading is always paired with concrete action.

If you follow this plan with a humble heart and ruthless consistency, by the end of twelve months you will not simply have _read_ the Canon-you will have begun to _live_ it.

---

## Core Rhythm

- **Weekly Commitment**

  - 2 Canon sessions per week (45-60 minutes each)
  - 1 Application block (30 minutes)
  - 1 Reflection block (15-30 minutes, preferably written)

- **Monthly Focus**  
  Each month carries a primary Canon theme and a single governing question.  
  Everything else is commentary.

---

## Month 1 - First Principles

**Theme:** Ultimate Purpose & First Allegiance  
**Governing Question:** _Who owns my life, my gifts, and my story-really?_

Recommended texts:

- _The Architecture of Human Purpose - Prelude sections_
- _The Canon: A Letter from the Author_ (resource)
- Key Scriptures: Psalm 8, Colossians 1:15-20, Romans 11:36

**Anchor Practice (Weekly):**

1. Read one section slowly.
2. Underline every phrase that names _purpose_, _design_, or _ownership_.
3. Capture a single sentence in your journal:

> "If this is true, then my life must change in this way..."

---

## Month 2 - Builders, Not Consumers

**Theme:** The Builder's Vocation  
**Governing Question:** _Am I building anything that will outlive my lifetime?_

Recommended texts:

- _The Builder's Catechism - Foundations_
- _Fatherhood Impact Framework_ (resource)
- _Leadership Standards Blueprint_ (resource)

**Application Block:**

- Identify **one** domain (home, work, church, city) where you will deliberately act as a builder, not a spectator, over the next 30 days.
- Define:
  - A single **standard** you will raise.
  - A single **structure** you will strengthen.
  - A single **soul** you will invest in.

---

## Month 3 - Households as Micro-Civilisations

**Theme:** Family Governance  
**Governing Question:** _Is my household ordered like a covenant or like a hotel?_

Pair the Canon's vision of the household with:

- _Purpose Alignment Checklist_ (resource)
- _Family Altar Liturgy_ (download)

Weekly, ask:

- What is one behaviour we **reward** at home?
- What is one behaviour we **tolerate** that is quietly undermining our future?

Document your answers. Patterns are policy.

---

## Months 4-12 - Long Obedience in One Direction

From Month 4 onwards, the plan fans out across:

- **Volume X - The Arc of Future Civilisation** (as released)
- _Destiny Mapping Worksheet_ and _Institutional Health Scorecard_
- Forthcoming Canon volumes and field guides.

For each month:

1. Choose **one Canon section** and **one supporting resource**.
2. Draft a **single sentence standard** that month will enforce.
3. Review progress at month-end with brutal honesty:
   - _What changed in my thinking?_
   - _What changed in my habits?_
   - _What changed in my household or institution?_

---

## Leading a Reading Cohort

The Canon is best absorbed in **small, serious cohorts**, not mass broadcasts.

If you are leading others:

- Keep groups between **3 and 7 people**.
- Require **commitment, not curiosity**. Missing more than two sessions is a pause.
- Start every gathering with:
  - 5 minutes of silence
  - One Canon paragraph, read aloud slowly
  - One Scripture that anchors the theme
- End with one question:

> "What will you actually do with what you heard today?"

Anything less is entertainment, not formation.

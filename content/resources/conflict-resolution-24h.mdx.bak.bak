## The 6-step play (facts → feelings → forward)
1. **Pause & pray (2 min):** regulate; no texting while hot.
2. **Write facts (2–5 lines):** _what happened_ with dates.
3. **Name the feeling (1 word):** angry, hurt, afraid, disappointed, ashamed.
4. **Own your slice (1 line):** _my part_ without ‘but’.
5. **Ask for the meeting (15 min):** same day if possible.
6. **Talk with B–P–F:**
   - **Brief:** facts in two sentences.
   - **Point:** what broke the standard.
   - **Forward:** proposal (decision, owner, date).

### Guardrails
- No triangulation; speak **to**, not **about**.
- No diagnosis; use **I** statements.
- End with **next check-in** date.

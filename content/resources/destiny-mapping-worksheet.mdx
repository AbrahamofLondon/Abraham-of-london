## Reflection Sections

### 1. **Gift Patterns**
What have you always been good at—even without training? Identify the "effortless" skills that others find difficult.

### 2. **Pain Signals**
What wounds shaped your worldview? In the economy of destiny, your greatest area of past suffering often becomes the site of your greatest future authority.

### 3. **Burden Identification**
What problems disturb you more than others? A "holy frustration" is often the first sign of an assignment.

### 4. **[Responsibility](/lexicon/responsibility) Appetite**
What roles have you naturally stepped into when there was a vacuum of leadership? Trace where you have historically been willing to pay the price of order.

### 5. **Vision Traces**
What themes keep recurring in your imagination? Not fantasies of escape, but blueprints for construction.

## The Synthesis: Destiny Statement

{"Use the data from the sections above to construct a 3-4 sentence synthesis of your current trajectory."}

**Construct your statement using this logic:**
* **Identity**: "I am a [Descriptor] called to..."
* **Assignment**: "...build and cultivate [Specific Domain]..."
* **Service**: "...for the benefit of [Specific People/Group]..."
* **Restoration**: "...to restore the standard of [Specific Value/Order]."

  {"Destiny leaves clues. If you trace the patterns of your burdens and your gifts, the silhouette of your mandate becomes visible. Trace them ruthlessly."}

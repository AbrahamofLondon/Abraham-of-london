# Destiny Mapping Worksheet

**A structured reflection for discovering your mandate**

This worksheet is a guided exploration of the hidden signals that point toward calling and destiny.

## Reflection Sections

### 1. **Gift Patterns**

- What have you always been good at - even without training?

### 2. **Pain Signals**

- What wounds shaped your worldview?

### 3. **Burden Identification**

- What problems disturb you more than others?

### 4. **Responsibility Appetite**

- What roles have you naturally stepped into?

### 5. **Vision Traces**

- What themes keep recurring in your imagination?

### 6. **Destiny Statement**

Write a 3-4 sentence synthesis of:

- who you are
- what you're called to build
- who you're called to serve
- what you're called to restore

> "Destiny leaves clues. Trace them."

Use this worksheet quarterly or annually to recalibrate direction.

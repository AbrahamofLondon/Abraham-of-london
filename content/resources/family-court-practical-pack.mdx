**IMPORTANT — READ FIRST (NON-LEGAL ADVICE)**
This pack provides **general educational strategy** and peer-to-peer frameworks. It is **not legal advice**, does not create a solicitor-client relationship, and may not fit your facts. Family proceedings are fact-sensitive and can involve safeguarding issues. If you are unsure, seek advice from a **regulated family law professional** or an appropriate support service. By using this resource, you accept responsibility for your decisions.
</Alert>

<Alert variant="foundational" icon="🧭">
**Institutional Principle**: The family court is not a forum for personal vindication; it is a forum for **risk management** and **the child's welfare**. Your job is to make it easy for the court to see what arrangement best serves the child.
</Alert>

## I. The Foundation: Mindset & Credibility

<TwoColumnLayout>
<Column>

### The Mental Framework
Your success is rarely about "verbal brilliance." It is about **credibility, consistency, and child focus**.

**Core Principles:**
* **Welfare First**: Everything is filtered through the child's welfare needs (not your grievances).
* **Stability Signal**: Judges look for predictable, regulated behaviour under pressure.
* **Long-View Discipline**: Family proceedings are slow. Avoid "reaction errors."

<TipBox title="Institutional Rule">
If you would regret it being read out loud in court, **do not write it**.
</TipBox>

</Column>
<Column>

### The BIFF Method
**Brief • Informative • Friendly • Firm**

Keep communications business-like:
* **Brief**: Short and focused.
* **Informative**: Facts and logistics only.
* **Friendly**: Neutral tone; no sarcasm.
* **Firm**: Clear requests and deadlines.

<WarningBox>
**Strategic Discipline**: Provocation is a trap. Every calm refusal to escalate is evidence for your stability.

## III. The Statement: Child-Focused Narrative

<Alert variant="critical" icon="📝">
Your **Position Statement** is the court-ready summary of what you want and why it benefits the child. It must read like an adult professional wrote it.
</Alert>

### The 3-Paragraph Summary Template

<TemplateBox title="Standard Application Summary">

**Paragraph 1 — Context** {"\"I am the father of [Child], born [DOB]. The child lives with the mother. Current contact is [describe current pattern/order].\""}

**Paragraph 2 — The Barrier** {"\"Since [date], contact has been inconsistent because [factual barrier]. I have attempted to resolve this by [mediation/steps]. This is affecting the child's stability.\""}

**Paragraph 3 — The Proposal** {"\"I seek an order specifying: [exact schedule]. This supports the child's welfare by providing [predictability and school routine].\""}

</TemplateBox>

<WarningBox>
**Avoid** diagnosing motives (e.g., "she is a narcissist"). **Do** present verifiable facts and a workable plan.
</WarningBox>

## V. Post-Hearing: Compliance & Breach

<Alert variant="wisdom" icon="⚖️">
A court order is the operating manual for the child's routine. Follow it with **precision**. Non-compliance damages credibility fast.
</Alert>

### Breach Protocol
If the other parent breaches an order, do not spiral. Use a controlled escalation path:

1. **Document immediately**: Record the date, time, and specific evidence of the breach.
2. **One calm message**: Ask for compliance and offer a practical fix (e.g., "I am outside for the 4 PM handover").
3. **Evidence Log**: Keep a chronologically ordered log of all missed contact.
4. **Restraint**: Do not withhold maintenance or retaliate with your own breach.

# Fatherhood Impact Framework

_A generational model for building identity, order, and destiny_

This resource defines the five domains every father must architect intentionally if he is to raise whole, grounded, resilient children.

## The 5 Domains

### 1. **Identity Formation**

- Who am I?
- What does it mean to carry this name?

### 2. **Moral Architecture**

- Teaching right, wrong, boundaries, and consequences
- Introducing the structure of wisdom

### 3. **Emotional Grounding**

- Stability
- Presence
- Regulated strength

### 4. **Skill Development**

- Competence
- Discipline
- Work ethic
- Curiosity

### 5. **Destiny Shaping**

- Vision
- Calling
- Purpose

> "A father's presence becomes a child's first definition of safety."

This framework is an anchor for every father's journey.

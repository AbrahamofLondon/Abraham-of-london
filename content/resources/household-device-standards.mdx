## Why standards?
Standards lower conflict and raise peace. Write them down, follow them daily, review monthly.

### Rules (print & post)
- **Meal times:** no phones on table. Devices parked in a basket before meals.
- **Bedrooms:** devices sleep in the **kitchen**; nothing charges in bedrooms.
- **Study block:** 45 minutes focus, 10 minutes break. Timer visible.
- **TV:** 2 school nights max; weekend slots agreed **Friday**.
- **Guests:** same device rules for friends.
- **Parentsâ€™ override:** we can pause/review any device for safety and learning.

### Enforcement (calm & consistent)
- 1st: reminder. 2nd: device parks for the day. 3rd: weekend TV slot removed.
- Always note **what happened**, **the standard**, **the reset**.

### Monthly review
- What worked? Where was friction? Adjust one rule **1%**.

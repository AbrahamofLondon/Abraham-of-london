## The 10 Metrics of Sovereignty

Score each domain from **1 (Chaos)** to **5 (Sovereignty)** to determine your Institutional Health Index.



1. **Moral [Integrity](/lexicon/integrity)**: Is there alignment between public claims and private actions?
2. **Cultural Consistency**: Does the "unwritten code" support the stated mission?
3. **[Governance](/lexicon/governance) Structure**: Are roles, authority, and accountability clearly defined?
4. **Succession Planning**: Is the institution dependent on a single personality, or can it endure a transition?
5. **Financial Discipline**: Is capital deployed with long-horizon stewardship or short-term reactivity?
6. **Strategic [Clarity](/lexicon/clarity)**: Is the "main thing" understood by every member of the team?
7. **Operational Coherence**: Do daily rhythms actually produce the desired strategic outcomes?
8. **People Development**: Is there a pipeline for forming the next generation of leaders?
9. **Decision-Making Frameworks**: Are decisions made via established principles or emotional whims?
10. **Crisis Preparedness**: Can the structure survive—and thrive—under unexpected pressure?

## Interpreting Your Score

* **40–50**: **Sovereign Institution**. Durable, self-correcting, and high-impact.
* **30–39**: **Functional**. Stable but vulnerable to cultural drift or leadership fatigue.
* **20–29**: **Fragile**. Significant structural debt; requires immediate governance intervention.
* **&lt;20**: **Decadent/Collapsing**. The institution is living on inherited momentum; deep reform is mandatory.

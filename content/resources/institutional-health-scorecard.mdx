# Institutional Health Scorecard

**Measure the true strength of any organisation**

This 10-point scorecard exposes the hidden weaknesses and quiet strengths of any institution - from families to corporations.

## The 10 Metrics

1. **Moral [Integrity](/vault/lexicon/integrity)**
2. **Cultural Consistency**
3. **[Governance](/vault/lexicon/governance) Structure**
4. **Succession Planning**
5. **Financial Discipline**
6. **Strategic [Clarity](/vault/lexicon/clarity)**
7. **Operational Coherence**
8. **People Development**
9. **Decision-Making Frameworks**
10. **Crisis Preparedness**

Score each domain from 1-5 to determine institutional health.

&gt; Strong institutions are engineered. Weak institutions are inherited.

Use this tool to evaluate your organisation, ministry, or personal projects.

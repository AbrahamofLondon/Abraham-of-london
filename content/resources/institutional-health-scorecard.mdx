# Institutional Health Scorecard  
**Measure the true strength of any organisation**

This 10-point scorecard exposes the hidden weaknesses and quiet strengths of any institution — from families to corporations.

## The 10 Metrics

1. **Moral Integrity**  
2. **Cultural Consistency**  
3. **Governance Structure**  
4. **Succession Planning**  
5. **Financial Discipline**  
6. **Strategic Clarity**  
7. **Operational Coherence**  
8. **People Development**  
9. **Decision-Making Frameworks**  
10. **Crisis Preparedness**

Score each domain from 1–5 to determine institutional health.

> Strong institutions are engineered. Weak institutions are inherited.

Use this tool to evaluate your organisation, ministry, or personal projects.

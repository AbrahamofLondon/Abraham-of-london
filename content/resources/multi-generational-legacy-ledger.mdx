# Multi-Generational Legacy Ledger

Most families talk about "legacy" as if it will magically appear if they are vaguely nice and vaguely successful.

The Canon is not that sentimental.  
It insists on **names, numbers, and non-negotiables**.

This ledger is designed to be completed on paper or in a spreadsheet, then reviewed annually by the head of household and relevant heirs.

---

## Step 1 - Map the Generations

Create a simple table with four columns:

- **G-1** - Parents / Grandparents (those who handed the baton to you)
- **G0** - You and your spouse (current household heads)
- **G+1** - Your children / direct heirs
- **G+2** - Grandchildren and beyond (by faith, if not yet born)

Under each column, list:

- Names
- Birth year
- Spiritual state (as honestly as you can describe it)
- Current location

You are not judging; you are **observing**.

---

## Step 2 - Identify Inherited Assets & Liabilities

For each generation, capture:

1. **Spiritual Assets**
   - Faithful examples, prayers, Scriptures, prophetic words.
2. **Character Assets**
   - Courage, diligence, loyalty, generosity, etc.
3. **Material Assets**
   - Land, businesses, savings, tools, professional access.
4. **Liabilities**
   - Patterns of addiction, sexual immorality, divorce, debt, corruption, cowardice, unbelief.

Write these down in plain language. The Canon has no time for euphemism.

---

## Step 3 - Define Canon Standards for Your Line

From the broader Canon principles, select **5-7 family standards** that must define your bloodline going forward. Examples:

- Our line will be known for **truth-telling**, even when expensive.
- Our line will never **trade integrity for office or contract**.
- Our line will be **builders of institutions**, not just consumers of comfort.
- Our line will **honour covenant marriage** and ruthlessly fight for it.

Write them in first person plural:

> "We will..." not "We hope to..."

These standards become the **north star** for all stewardship decisions.

---

## Step 4 - Assign Stewardships (Not Just Inheritances)

For each child or heir (G+1 and G+2), assign:

- **Primary Stewardship Area**
  - e.g., business, ministry, law, education, culture, justice, governance.
- **Formation Track**
  - What books must they read?
  - Which skills must they master?
  - Which elders must they walk with?

Record:

- _Name_ - _Area_ - _Next Three Steps_ - _Review Date_

This ledger is not about controlling people's destinies; it is about **stacking the deck in favour of obedience**.

---

## Step 5 - Assets Deployment Plan

List your major assets (current and anticipated):

- Properties
- Businesses and shares
- Intellectual property
- Savings and instruments
- Strategic relationships

For each, answer:

1. _What is this asset for in the Canon story of our line?_
2. _Who is responsible to steward it if we die sooner than expected?_
3. _What covenants or conditions must govern its use?_

Translate this thinking into:

- Wills and trusts (with competent legal advice).
- Written letters to heirs explaining **why** as well as **what**.

---

## Step 6 - Risk Register & Guardrails

If you ignore your own patterns, your heirs will pay for your denial.

Create a simple **risk register**:

- **Risk** - e.g., "We are prone to financial naivety", "We avoid conflict", "We chase status."
- **Impact** - Low / Medium / High
- **Mitigation** - Which habit, counsel, or structure will restrain this risk?

Examples of guardrails:

- External financial oversight for large decisions.
- Pre-marital and marital counselling as a standard, not an emergency measure.
- Family rule: no major move or investment without waiting, prayer, and counsel.

---

## Step 7 - Annual Canon Legacy Session

Once a year:

- Gather key family members.
- Review this ledger.
- Update names, assets, liabilities, and stewardships.
- Confess where standards were broken; celebrate where grace was evident.

End by re-reading your family standards aloud and praying together.

> Legacy is not what you _wish_ for your descendants.  
> It is what you **design, steward, and defend**-one decision at a time.

# Multi-Generational [Legacy](/lexicon/legacy) Ledger

Most families talk about "legacy" as if it will magically appear if they are vaguely nice and vaguely successful.

The Canon is not that sentimental.
It insists on **names, numbers, and non-negotiables**.

This ledger is designed to be completed on paper or in a spreadsheet, then reviewed annually by the head of household and relevant heirs.






## Step 2 - Identify Inherited Assets & Liabilities

For each generation, capture:

1. **Spiritual Assets**
   - Faithful examples, prayers, Scriptures, prophetic words.
2. **Character Assets**
   - Courage, diligence, loyalty, generosity, etc.
3. **Material Assets**
   - Land, businesses, savings, tools, professional access.
4. **Liabilities**
   - Patterns of addiction, sexual immorality, divorce, debt, corruption, cowardice, unbelief.

Write these down in plain language. The Canon has no time for euphemism.






## Step 4 - Assign Stewardships (Not Just Inheritances)

For each child or heir (G+1 and G+2), assign:

- **Primary Stewardship Area**
  - e.g., business, ministry, law, education, culture, justice, governance.
- **Formation Track**
  - What books must they read?
  - Which skills must they master?
  - Which elders must they walk with?

Record:

- _Name_ - _Area_ - _Next Three Steps_ - _Review Date_

This ledger is not about controlling people's destinies; it is about **stacking the deck in favour of obedience**.






## Step 6 - Risk Register & Guardrails

If you ignore your own patterns, your heirs will pay for your denial.

Create a simple **risk register**:

- **Risk** - e.g., "We are prone to financial naivety", "We avoid conflict", "We chase status."
- **Impact** - Low / Medium / High
- **Mitigation** - Which habit, counsel, or structure will restrain this risk?

Examples of guardrails:

- External financial oversight for large decisions.
- Pre-marital and marital counselling as a standard, not an emergency measure.
- [Family](/lexicon/family) rule: no major move or investment without waiting, prayer, and counsel.

## Step 7 - Annual Canon [Legacy](/lexicon/legacy) Session

Once a year:

- Gather key family members.
- Review this ledger.
- Update names, assets, liabilities, and stewardships.
- Confess where standards were broken; celebrate where grace was evident.

End by re-reading your family standards aloud and praying together.

&gt; [Legacy](/lexicon/legacy) is not what you _wish_ for your descendants.
&gt; It is what you **design, steward, and defend**-one decision at a time.

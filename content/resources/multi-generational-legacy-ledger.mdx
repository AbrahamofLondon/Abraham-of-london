# Multi-Generational Legacy Ledger

Most families talk about "legacy" as if it will magically appear if they are vaguely nice and vaguely successful.

The Canon is not that sentimental.  
It insists on **names, numbers, and non-negotiables**.

This ledger is designed to be completed on paper or in a spreadsheet, then reviewed annually by the head of household and relevant heirs.

## Step 2 - Identify Inherited Assets & Liabilities

For each generation, capture:

1. **Spiritual Assets**
   - Faithful examples, prayers, Scriptures, prophetic words.
2. **Character Assets**
   - Courage, diligence, loyalty, generosity, etc.
3. **Material Assets**
   - Land, businesses, savings, tools, professional access.
4. **Liabilities**
   - Patterns of addiction, sexual immorality, divorce, debt, corruption, cowardice, unbelief.

Write these down in plain language. The Canon has no time for euphemism.

## Step 4 - Assign Stewardships (Not Just Inheritances)

For each child or heir (G+1 and G+2), assign:

- **Primary Stewardship Area**
  - e.g., business, ministry, law, education, culture, justice, governance.
- **Formation Track**
  - What books must they read?
  - Which skills must they master?
  - Which elders must they walk with?

Record:

- _Name_ - _Area_ - _Next Three Steps_ - _Review Date_

This ledger is not about controlling people's destinies; it is about **stacking the deck in favour of obedience**.

## Step 6 - Risk Register & Guardrails

If you ignore your own patterns, your heirs will pay for your denial.

Create a simple **risk register**:

- **Risk** - e.g., "We are prone to financial naivety", "We avoid conflict", "We chase status."
- **Impact** - Low / Medium / High
- **Mitigation** - Which habit, counsel, or structure will restrain this risk?

Examples of guardrails:

- External financial oversight for large decisions.
- Pre-marital and marital counselling as a standard, not an emergency measure.
- Family rule: no major move or investment without waiting, prayer, and counsel.

## Step 7 - Annual Canon Legacy Session

Once a year:

- Gather key family members.
- Review this ledger.
- Update names, assets, liabilities, and stewardships.
- Confess where standards were broken; celebrate where grace was evident.

End by re-reading your family standards aloud and praying together.

> Legacy is not what you _wish_ for your descendants.  
> It is what you **design, steward, and defend**-one decision at a time.

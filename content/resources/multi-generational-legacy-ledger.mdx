# Multi-Generational [Legacy](/lexicon/legacy) Ledger

{"Most families treat 'legacy' as a romantic hope. The Canon treats it as a design challenge. This ledger insists on names, numbers, and non-negotiables."}

## Step 1: The Multi-Generational Map



Before filling out the ledger, visualize your timeline. You are G0 (Generation Zero). Your ancestors are the negative integers; your descendants are the positive. Your goal is to stabilize the line for G+3.

---

## Step 2: Identify Inherited Assets & Liabilities

For each generation, capture the reality without euphemism.

1.  **Spiritual Assets**: Faithful examples, prayers, Scriptures, prophetic words.
2.  **Character Assets**: Courage, diligence, loyalty, generosity.
3.  **Material Assets**: Land, businesses, savings, tools, professional access.
4.  **Liabilities**: Patterns of addiction, sexual immorality, divorce, debt, corruption, cowardice.

---

## Step 3: Assign Stewardships (Not Just Inheritances)

Assigning money without assigning a mission is a recipe for decadence. For each heir (G+1 and G+2), define:

* **Primary Stewardship Area**: e.g., Business, Ministry, Law, Education, Governance.
* **Formation Track**: What books must they read? Which skills must they master? Which elders must they walk with?
* **The Record**: `[Name] — [Area] — [Next Three Steps] — [Review Date]`

## Step 4: Risk Register & Guardrails

{"If you ignore your own patterns, your heirs will pay for your denial."}

Construct a ledger of internal and external threats to the family mission.

| Risk Category | Example Threat | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Financial** | "Prone to status-chasing / vanity debt." | High | External oversight for any purchase >£10k. |
| **Relational** | "Pattern of conflict avoidance." | Medium | Mandatory quarterly 'Clearance' sessions. |
| **Moral** | "Historical lack of sexual discipline." | High | High-accountability travel and digital protocols. |

## Step 5: The Annual Canon [Legacy](/lexicon/legacy) Session

Legacy is defended one decision at a time. Once a year, the household must:

1.  **Gather**: Bring together the key stewards and heirs.
2.  **Audit**: Review the ledger. Update names, assets, and liabilities.
3.  **Confess & Celebrate**: Be honest about where standards were broken; celebrate where order was restored.
4.  **Re-Commit**: Re-read the family standards aloud and pray.

&gt; {"Legacy is not what you wish for your descendants. It is what you design, steward, and defend."}

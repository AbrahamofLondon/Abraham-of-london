# Purpose Alignment Checklist

**A quick diagnostic for clarity, order, and direction**

Use this checklist as a monthly or quarterly audit for purpose-driven living.

## Alignment Indicators

- ☐ I know my current mandate
- ☐ My decisions align with my identity and values
- ☐ My relationships reinforce, not sabotage, my purpose
- ☐ My daily habits move me toward long-term outcomes
- ☐ My emotional environment is orderly, not chaotic
- ☐ I am building something that outlasts me
- ☐ I am growing in responsibility, not retreating into comfort

> Alignment produces acceleration. Misalignment produces exhaustion.

Review this checklist whenever your pace or peace feels off.

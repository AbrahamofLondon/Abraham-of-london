# Strategy Room Intake

{"This intake exists to protect signal. The Strategy Room is a high-gravity environment reserved for leaders who are ready to decide, not just discuss."}



## I. The Objective
This instrument answers three questions before a session is scheduled:
1. **Decision Integrity**: Is there a real, irreversible decision to be made?
2. **Authority Audit**: Does the applicant carry the authority to execute, or only the anxiety of the outcome?
3. **Cost of Delay**: Is the price of inaction already quantified and visible?

**If these conditions are not met, the room is not opened.**

## II. Operational Boundaries

To maintain the standard of excellence, it is essential to define what this environment is **not**:
* **Not Coaching**: We are not focused on your personal "journey" but on institutional outcomes.
* **Not Brainstorming**: Exploratory talk is for the workshop; the Strategy Room is for the blueprint.
* **Not Therapy**: We do not use business vocabulary to solve emotional problems.
* **Not Advisory "Lites"**: We do not provide "opinions"; we provide constraint-aware strategies.

---

## III. Institutional Output
Every successful Strategy Room deployment produces:
* **A Decision**: Or a disciplined, timed deferral with defined criteria.
* **A Strategy**: Rooted in current constraints, not idealistic projections.
* **Governance Points**: Execution cadences and control points to prevent drift.
* **Explicit Trade-offs**: A clear mapping of what is being sacrificed to achieve the goal.

## IV. Next Steps & Pre-Reads

{"If accepted, you will receive a specific pre-read pack from the Canon-aligned Frameworks library. This is non-negotiable preparation."}

**If you are not yet ready for a Strategy Room, we recommend starting with:**
* **Strategic Frameworks**: [Browse the Library](/resources/strategic-frameworks)
* **Inner Circle**: [Access Higher Signal Intellectual Assets](/inner-circle)

# Strategy Room Intake

## What this is
This intake exists to protect signal.

It is designed to answer three questions before a Strategy Room is scheduled:

1. **Is there a real decision to be made?**
2. **Does the applicant carry authority--or only anxiety?**
3. **Is the cost of delay already visible?**

If these are not true, the room is not booked.

## What a Strategy Room is not
- Not coaching
- Not exploratory brainstorming
- Not "tell me what you think"
- Not therapy with business vocabulary

## What a Strategy Room produces
- A decision (or a disciplined deferral)
- A constraint-aware strategy
- Execution cadence + governance control points
- A defined trade-off (explicit, not hidden)

## Pre-reads
If accepted, the applicant receives a brief pre-read pack from the Canon-aligned Frameworks library.

## Where to begin
If you are not ready for a Strategy Room, start with:

- **Strategic Frameworks**: `/resources/strategic-frameworks`
- **Inner Circle** (higher signal): `/inner-circle`

# The Vault

This is a library of **operational artifacts** -- built to be filled, printed clean, archived, and reused.

If it's "soft" (image-only) or prints dirty, it doesn't belong here.

## What's inside
- **[Purpose](/lexicon/purpose) Pyramid Worksheet (fillable PDF)**
- **Decision Matrix Scorecard (fillable PDF)**
- **[Legacy](/lexicon/legacy) Canvas (fillable PDF)**
- **Board Decision Log (Excel)**
- **Operating Cadence Pack (deck)**

## Access
Some items are public. Higher-grade assets are Inner Circle gated.

If you hit a lock, that's not a bug -- it's governance.

# The Vault

This is not a “resources page.”

This is where **operationally useful artifacts** live — the kind you can take into a board room, a leadership review, a turnaround meeting, or a household governance session and actually **move decisions forward**.

## What qualifies
Vault-grade assets must be:

- **Fillable** (PDFs must accept typed input)
- **Print-clean** (no fuzzy scan artifacts, no misaligned lines)
- **Export-clean** (you can archive and share without degradation)
- **Governance-aware** (built for accountability, not vibes)

If it’s “soft” (image-only), it’s not vault-grade. It’s a draft wearing a suit.

## Current artifact set
- **Purpose Pyramid Worksheet (PDF)** — clarify aim, constraints, and trade-offs.
- **Decision Matrix Scorecard (PDF)** — quantify priorities and prevent emotional decisions.
- **Legacy Canvas (PDF)** — align long-term direction across domains.
- **Board Decision Log Template (Excel)** — auditable decision history and accountability.
- **Operating Cadence Pack (Deck)** — meetings, rhythms, escalation, and control points.

## How downloads work
Downloads are routed through a controlled endpoint.  
If an asset requires a tier, the system enforces it.

- Public assets can be downloaded directly.
- Inner Circle assets require access (and are tracked for audit and improvement).

Most people are waiting for a miracle.  
But sometimes the miracle is a decision.

A single yes.

Yes to help.  
Yes to therapy.  
Yes to honesty.  
Yes to starting again.


<!-- stripped: duplicate frontmatter block -->


Don't despise small yeses.

A yes is a gate.

It opens the path  
to the person you're meant to become.

If you're stuck, pick one yes today:

- yes to rest  
- yes to a boundary  
- yes to seeking counsel  
- yes to starting the work you keep avoiding

Not because you feel ready.  
Because you're done being trapped by hesitation.

Sometimes the whole new chapter begins  
with one quiet yes  
nobody else even sees.

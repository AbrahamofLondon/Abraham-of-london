There are days when motivation is a joke.

You're not lazy.  
You're not ungrateful.

You're just carrying too much, too quietly.


{/* stripped: duplicate frontmatter block */}


If today is heavy:

- Drink water.  
- Eat something simple.  
- Step outside for two minutes.  
- Text one safe person: "I'm not okay."

That's not weakness.  
That's wisdom.

You don't have to be impressive today.

Some days, the victory is not progress.  
It's **presence**.

And if all you can do is breathe,  
then breathe like someone who still plans to return.

  There are days when motivation is a joke. You're not lazy. You're not
  ungrateful. You're just carrying too much, too quietly.

There are days when motivation is a joke.

You're not lazy.
You're not ungrateful.

You're just carrying too much, too quietly.





If today is heavy:

- Drink water.
- Eat something simple.
- Step outside for two minutes.
- Text one safe person: "I'm not okay."

That's not weakness.
That's wisdom.

You don't have to be impressive today.

Some days, the victory is not progress.
It's **presence**.

And if all you can do is breathe,
then breathe like someone who still plans to return.

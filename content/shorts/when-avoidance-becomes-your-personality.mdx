You don’t like drama.  
You’re “easy-going”.  
You “let things slide”.

That’s the story you tell.

But if we could mic your nervous system,  
we’d hear it screaming.

Avoidance is sophisticated. It dresses up as:

- *“I can’t be bothered.”*  
- *“It’s not that deep.”*  
- *“I just hate confrontation.”*

But here’s the quiet invoice it sends:

- Resentment with a polite smile.  
- Anxiety every time your phone lights up.  
- Rage you only feel when you’re alone.

You’re not keeping the peace.  
You’re delaying the explosion.

The hard truth:

Every conflict you avoid externally  
you host internally.

You are arguing **for them**,  
**to them**,  
**about them**,  
in a courtroom inside your skull  
they never have to enter.

They continue their lives.  
You keep replaying scenes they don’t even remember.

This week, choose one small confrontation:

- Saying, *“That hurt me.”*  
- Saying, *“I’m not okay with that tone.”*  
- Saying, *“I can’t do that for you anymore.”*

No lectures.  
No essays.  
Just one clear line in the sand.

You may shake.  
You may overthink every word.

But the first time you choose honest conflict  
over fake harmony,  
you’ll realise peace was never the absence of discomfort.  
It was the presence of truth.

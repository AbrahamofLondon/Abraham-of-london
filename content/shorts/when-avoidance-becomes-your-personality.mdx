You don't like drama.
You're "easy-going".
You "let things slide".

That's the story you tell.

But if we could mic your nervous system,
we'd hear it screaming.


{/* stripped: duplicate frontmatter block */}


The hard truth:

Every conflict you avoid externally
you host internally.

You are arguing **for them**,
**to them**,
**about them**,
in a courtroom inside your skull
they never have to enter.

They continue their lives.
You keep replaying scenes they don't even remember.

This week, choose one small confrontation:

- Saying, *"That hurt me."*
- Saying, *"I'm not okay with that tone."*
- Saying, *"I can't do that for you anymore."*

No lectures.
No essays.
Just one clear line in the sand.

You may shake.
You may overthink every word.

But the first time you choose honest conflict
over fake harmony,
you'll realise peace was never the absence of discomfort.
It was the presence of truth.

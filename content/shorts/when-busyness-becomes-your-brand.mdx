Some people don't just have a schedule.  
They have a persona:

Busy.

Always booked.  
Always rushing.  
Always "a lot going on."

It sounds important.

But sometimes busyness is not workload.  
It's avoidance with status.

Here's the confrontation:

If you're too busy for your own soul,  
your life is out of order.

You can't lead, love, or build well  
while living in constant haste.

Haste doesn't create greatness.  
It creates fragility.

This week, commit one small act of un-busying:

- leave one day with whitespace  
- say no to one non-essential thing  
- stop wearing exhaustion like proof of worth

Busy is not a personality.  
It's a phase - unless you keep worshipping it.

Some people can argue and move on.

You?  
Conflict hits deeper.

It feels like rejection.

Like something is about to end.

So you either over-explain,  
or shut down,  
or apologise too fast -  
just to make the tension disappear.


<!-- stripped: duplicate frontmatter block -->


Healthy relationships can hold tension.

They can disagree without threatening love.

But you won't experience that  
if you keep reacting like every conflict is a break-up.

This week, practice a new response:

- breathe before you speak  
- ask: "Are we safe?"  
- say: "I don't want to fight - I want to understand."

If the other person can't hold that, note it.

Because your healing isn't just learning to argue.  
It's learning to stay present  
without panicking.

Conflict is not betrayal.  
Sometimes it's the pathway to deeper trust.

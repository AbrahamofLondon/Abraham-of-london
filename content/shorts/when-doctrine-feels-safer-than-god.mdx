Doctrine matters.

Truth matters.

But doctrine can become a hiding place
for people who are scared of intimacy with God.

Because doctrine is controllable.
God is not.

Here's the uncomfortable reality:

Some people use doctrine
to avoid surrender.

Because surrender means God can ask for things:

- forgiveness you don't want to give
- obedience that costs reputation
- integrity that removes comfort

Doctrine lets you stay informed
without being transformed.

This week, shift from information to encounter:

- pray without performing
- read one Gospel passage slowly
- ask: "Lord, what do You want from me right now?"

Not a lecture.
A response.

Truth is not meant to be displayed.
Truth is meant to be lived.

And God is not a concept to be mastered.
He is a King to be obeyed - and a [Father](/vault/lexicon/father) to be known.

You level up.

New title.  
New pay.  
New respect.

And for about 48 hours you feel alive.

Then the emptiness returns.

---

Because a promotion can't fix:

- an unloved inner life  
- a neglected family  
- a spiritual drought  
- a purpose problem

It can only upgrade your comfort.

Here's the confrontation:

If your joy depends on the next milestone,  
you're not building a career.  
You're chasing a mirage.

The goalpost will keep moving  
until you move the centre of your life.

This week, ask a question that scares high-performers:

What is my work **for**?

Not what does it pay.  
Not what does it prove.

What does it serve?

If the answer is only ego,  
you'll keep winning and feeling hollow.

---

You don't need less success.  
You need alignment.

Because climbing a ladder  
leaning against the wrong wall  
is still a loss -  
just a prestigious one.

Some of your lowest moments  
weren't loud.

They were quiet:

The day you realised you'd drifted.  
The day you broke your own standards.  
The day you didn't recognise yourself.

---
Shame told you:  
"Hide."  
"Pretend."  
"Perform."

But grace does something strange.

It doesn't excuse you.  
It doesn't flatter you.

It meets you -  
and tells you the truth without crushing you.

If you're in a mess right now:

Stop bargaining.

Stop promising God a new personality  
just to earn relief.

Just come.

Confess what's real.  
Name what's broken.  
Ask for strength.

Grace is not permission to stay the same.  
It's power to become whole.

And sometimes the most shocking thing God does  
is not exposing you to destroy you...

but exposing you  
so He can finally heal you.

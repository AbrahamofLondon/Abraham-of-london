Hope used to feel natural.

Now it feels risky.

Because you've learned what it feels like  
to believe hard... and still lose.

So you've become "realistic."  
Guarded.  
Careful.

You don't call it fear.  
You call it wisdom.

Here's the uncomfortable truth:

Some people don't lose faith because they stop believing in God.  
They lose faith because they stop believing in goodness.

They stop expecting light.  
So darkness becomes normal.

This week, practice a small hope - not a fantasy:

- Hope for one repaired conversation.  
- One open door.  
- One moment of peace.  
- One day you don't feel like you're drowning.

Hope doesn't mean you're naive.  
It means you're refusing to let pain be the final prophet.

Sometimes hope is not a feeling.  
It's defiance.

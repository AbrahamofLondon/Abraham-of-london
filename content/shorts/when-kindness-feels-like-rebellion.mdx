Some people have become harsh  
because life trained them.

They call it wisdom.  
But sometimes it's just unhealed pain.

---

So when you choose kindness now,  
it feels like rebellion.

Not naive kindness.  
Not enabling.

But deliberate gentleness  
in a world addicted to cruelty.

---

Kindness is costly.

It means you don't become what wounded you.

It means you keep your humanity  
even when it would be easier to numb it.

---

This week, choose one act of clean kindness:

- speak gently when you could snap  
- honour someone's dignity without performing it  
- forgive one small offence without announcing it

In a culture of sharp edges,  
gentleness is strength under control.

And sometimes the holiest thing you can do  
is refuse to harden.

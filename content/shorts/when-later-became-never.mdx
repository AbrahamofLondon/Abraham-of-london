You didn&apos;t quit.

You postponed.

You delayed.  
You &quot;waited for the right time.&quot;  
You told yourself you were being wise.

And one day you looked up  
and realised &quot;later&quot; had turned into never.

This is how dreams die.

Not through a single tragedy,  
but through a thousand small delays:

- &quot;I&apos;ll start after this busy season.&quot;  
- &quot;I&apos;ll fix it when I have more money.&quot;  
- &quot;I&apos;ll take it seriously when life settles down.&quot;

Life doesn&apos;t settle down.  
It shifts shape.

And your excuses shift with it.

Here&apos;s the raw truth:

You don&apos;t need more time.  
You need more truth.

Because the real reason is often:

- fear of failing  
- fear of being seen  
- fear of commitment  
- fear of success

So you keep your dream in theory.  
Theory is safe.  
Reality demands courage.

This week, choose one &quot;later&quot; and kill it:

- schedule it  
- start it badly  
- do 30 minutes  
- send the email  
- make the call

Your future won&apos;t be built by intentions.  
It will be built by actions you stopped negotiating.

Later is a liar.  
And you&apos;ve listened long enough.

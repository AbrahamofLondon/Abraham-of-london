You didn’t quit.

You postponed.

You delayed.  
You “waited for the right time.”  
You told yourself you were being wise.

And one day you looked up  
and realised “later” had turned into never.

This is how dreams die.

Not through a single tragedy,  
but through a thousand small delays:

- “I’ll start after this busy season.”  
- “I’ll fix it when I have more money.”  
- “I’ll take it seriously when life settles down.”

Life doesn’t settle down.  
It shifts shape.

And your excuses shift with it.

Here’s the raw truth:

You don’t need more time.  
You need more truth.

Because the real reason is often:

- fear of failing  
- fear of being seen  
- fear of commitment  
- fear of success

So you keep your dream in theory.  
Theory is safe.  
Reality demands courage.

This week, choose one “later” and kill it:

- schedule it  
- start it badly  
- do 30 minutes  
- send the email  
- make the call

Your future won’t be built by intentions.  
It will be built by actions you stopped negotiating.

Later is a liar.  
And you’ve listened long enough.

You didn&apos;t quit.

You postponed.

You delayed.
You &quot;waited for the right time.&quot;
You told yourself you were being wise.

And one day you looked up
and realised &quot;later&quot; had turned into never.

Here&apos;s the raw truth:

You don&apos;t need more time.
You need more truth.

Because the real reason is often:

- fear of failing
- fear of being seen
- fear of commitment
- fear of success

So you keep your dream in theory.
Theory is safe.
Reality demands courage.

This week, choose one &quot;later&quot; and kill it:

- schedule it
- start it badly
- do 30 minutes
- send the email
- make the call

Your future won&apos;t be built by intentions.
It will be built by actions you stopped negotiating.

Later is a liar.
And you&apos;ve listened long enough.

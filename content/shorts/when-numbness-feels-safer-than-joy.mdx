Numbness is not peace.

It's a ceasefire.

It's what you choose
when you've been disappointed enough times
that feeling deeply starts to look stupid.

So you flatten your emotions.

No highs.
No lows.
Just functioning.

Here's the challenge:

Joy requires vulnerability.

And if vulnerability has been punished in your life,
you will treat joy like a trap.

You'll keep waiting for the "catch."

This week, practice safe joy:

- one meal eaten slowly
- one walk with your shoulders relaxed
- one moment of laughter without immediately "getting back to work"

And when the guilt tries to interrupt, tell it the truth:

Restoration is not laziness.
Joy is not betrayal.
Peace is not suspicious.

You're not childish for wanting to feel alive again.

You're healing.

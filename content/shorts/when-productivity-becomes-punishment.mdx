You tell yourself you're disciplined.  
Driven. Ambitious.

And in many ways, you are.

But some of what you call "work ethic"  
is really just **self-punishment** in a suit.


{/* stripped: duplicate frontmatter block */}


Productivity is a wonderful servant  
and a brutal god.

When your worth is tied to output:

- Failure feels like moral collapse.  
- Rest feels like theft.  
- Saying "no" feels like rebellion.

You are not a project.  
You are a person.

This week, test yourself:

- Schedule one hour with **no objective**.  
  No "catching up". No "getting ahead".  
- Don't fill it with a screen.  
- Let whatever surfaces... surface.

If tears come, don't rebuke them.  
If anger comes, don't theologise it away.

You're not lazy for needing rest.  
You're human for needing mercy.

And some of the harshest bosses you've ever worked for  
lived in your own head.

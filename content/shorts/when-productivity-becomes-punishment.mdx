You tell yourself you're disciplined.  
Driven. Ambitious.

And in many ways, you are.

But some of what you call "work ethic"  
is really just **self-punishment** in a suit.

---
You don't rest. You "earn" rest.  
You don't pause. You "crash".

Downtime feels illegal,  
so you fill it with:

- More tasks.  
- More scrolling.  
- More noise.

Anywhere but alone with your own thoughts.

Because you suspect that in the silence,  
you'd have to admit:

- You're not as happy as your life looks.  
- You're angrier than your posts sound.  
- You're lonelier than your calendar suggests.

Productivity is a wonderful servant  
and a brutal god.

When your worth is tied to output:

- Failure feels like moral collapse.  
- Rest feels like theft.  
- Saying "no" feels like rebellion.

You are not a project.  
You are a person.

This week, test yourself:

- Schedule one hour with **no objective**.  
  No "catching up". No "getting ahead".  
- Don't fill it with a screen.  
- Let whatever surfaces... surface.

If tears come, don't rebuke them.  
If anger comes, don't theologise it away.

You're not lazy for needing rest.  
You're human for needing mercy.

And some of the harshest bosses you've ever worked for  
lived in your own head.

Some people can't rest
without feeling guilty.

Others can't rest
without feeling afraid.

Because when you slow down,
you start to hear what you've been outrunning.





This is not condemnation.
It's clarity.

You don't need a harsher schedule.
You need healing.

Try this tonight:

- Sit still for five minutes.
- No phone. No music. No productivity.
- Breathe and notice what rises.

If anxiety rises, don't panic.
Just name it.

Because what you refuse to face
will always demand to be chased.

Rest isn't dangerous.
Unprocessed pain is.

And your body is not your enemy.
It's your messenger.

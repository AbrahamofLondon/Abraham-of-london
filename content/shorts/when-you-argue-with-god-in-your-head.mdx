You don't call it doubt.

You call it "processing."  
"being realistic."  
"thinking deeply."

But if we're honest, you've been arguing with God.

In your head.
---

You don't pray like a child anymore.  
You pray like a lawyer.

You present evidence:

- "Look how long it's been."  
- "Look what they got away with."  
- "Look how hard I tried."

And when nothing changes, you conclude:  
"He's silent."  
"He's distant."  
"He's not fair."

Here's the strange truth:

God is not threatened by your questions.  
He is threatened by your **pretence**.

The Psalms are full of what you're scared to say:

- Why?  
- How long?  
- Where are You?  
- Do You even see this?

That's not unbelief.  
That's relationship without cosmetics.

This week, stop arguing in your head and start speaking plainly:

- "Lord, I'm angry."  
- "Lord, I'm tired."  
- "Lord, I don't understand You."  
- "Lord, I don't like what You allowed."

Then sit quietly.

Not because you'll like the silence -  
but because you're finally being real.

Faith isn't pretending.  
Faith is staying in the conversation.

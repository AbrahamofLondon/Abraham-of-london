Overthinking feels responsible.

It feels like:

“I’m being thorough.”

But most overthinking is not analysis.

It’s avoidance.

Because a decision requires risk
and risk requires courage.

So you keep spinning thoughts
to delay the moment you have to move.

This week, interrupt the loop:

- pick the next best step
- do it within 24 hours
- accept that you can adjust later

Most decisions aren’t forever.
They’re directional.

You don’t need perfect clarity.
You need movement.

Overthinking is not your personality.
It’s a habit.

And you can break habits by acting.

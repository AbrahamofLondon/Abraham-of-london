Overthinking feels responsible.

It feels like:

“I’m being thorough.”

But most overthinking is not analysis.

It’s avoidance.

Because a decision requires risk  
and risk requires courage.

So you keep spinning thoughts  
to delay the moment you have to move.

Here’s the blunt truth:

If thinking hasn’t produced action,  
it’s not wisdom.  
It’s fear.

Fear of choosing wrong.  
Fear of being judged.  
Fear of failing.

So you calculate forever  
and call it maturity.

This week, interrupt the loop:

- pick the next best step  
- do it within 24 hours  
- accept that you can adjust later

Most decisions aren’t forever.  
They’re directional.

You don’t need perfect clarity.  
You need movement.

Overthinking is not your personality.  
It’s a habit.

And you can break habits by acting.

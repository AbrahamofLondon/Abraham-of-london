Drifting doesn't feel dramatic.

It feels normal.

You still function.  
Still show up.  
Still look "fine".

But something inside you is quietly unmooring.

---

Growth has markers:

- More honesty.  
- More humility.  
- More clarity.  
- More responsibility.

Drifting also has markers:

- More numbness.  
- More excuses.  
- More distraction.  
- More "I'll fix it later."

The dangerous part?  
Both can look identical on the outside.

Here's a blunt question:

Are you becoming more **awake**,  
or more **busy**?

Because a lot of people don't lose themselves through sin.  
They lose themselves through noise.

They don't fall off a cliff.  
They slowly step away from what's true  
until they can't remember what "true" even felt like.

---

Tonight, do a real audit:

- What conviction have you been negotiating?  
- What truth have you been delaying?  
- What voice have you replaced with the crowd's opinion?

If you feel exposed, good.  
That's not condemnation.  
That's recalibration.

Drifting is not your identity.  
It's just what happens when you stop steering.

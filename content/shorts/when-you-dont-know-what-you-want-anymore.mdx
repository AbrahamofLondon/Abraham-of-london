  You used to be certain. Now everything feels foggy - and you're tempted to pretend it's fine.

Not knowing what you want  
isn't always confusion.

Sometimes it's exhaustion.

When you've spent years being what others needed,  
your own desires start to feel unfamiliar - even suspicious.

---
You used to know:

What mattered.  
Where you were going.  
Who you wanted to become.

Now you scroll, work, survive, repeat -  
and call it "being realistic."

But deep down, you're unsettled.

---

Here's the hard diagnosis:

You might not be lost.  
You might be unlistening.

Because desire is often the first thing we silence  
when we're trying to be responsible, mature, composed.

Try this tonight:

- Write three things you *used* to care about.  
- Circle one that still stirs you - even slightly.  
- Ask: "What did I trade this for?"

That answer will sting.  
Good.

Clarity doesn't always come like a lightning bolt.  
Sometimes it comes like a quiet ache  
that refuses to die.

Follow the ache.

Some of you don’t make decisions.

You collect permissions.

You ask everyone:

- friends  
- mentors  
- the internet  
- strangers in comments

Then you still feel anxious.

Because the problem isn’t lack of advice.

It’s lack of trust in yourself.

This often comes from past punishment.

If you were shamed for mistakes,  
you learned that choosing wrong equals danger.

So you hesitate forever.

Here’s the truth:

Confidence doesn’t come before decisions.  
It comes after repeated decisions.

You build it by:

- choosing  
- learning  
- adjusting  
- choosing again

This week, reclaim agency:

- decide one small thing without consulting anyone  
- follow through  
- forgive yourself for imperfection

You don’t need perfect outcomes  
to trust yourself.

You need evidence that you can recover.

And you can.

Some of you don’t make decisions.

You collect permissions.

You ask everyone:

- friends  
- mentors  
- the internet  
- strangers in comments

Then you still feel anxious.

Because the problem isn’t lack of advice.

It’s lack of trust in yourself.

Here’s the truth:

Confidence doesn’t come before decisions.  
It comes after repeated decisions.

You build it by:

- choosing  
- learning  
- adjusting  
- choosing again

This week, reclaim agency:

- decide one small thing without consulting anyone  
- follow through  
- forgive yourself for imperfection

You don’t need perfect outcomes  
to trust yourself.

You need evidence that you can recover.

And you can.

Some doubts aren't rebellious.
They're terrified.

Because if you were wrong about God,
what else collapses?

Your morality.
Your meaning.
Your hope.
Your suffering.

So you keep questions locked away
and call it "faith."


{/* stripped: duplicate frontmatter block */}


Here's the mature posture:

Ask the hard questions
without becoming cynical.

Seek truth
without becoming arrogant.

Hold conviction
without pretending you're omniscient.

This week, do something brave:

- write down your biggest fear about God
- not the polite fear - the real one
- then bring it into prayer honestly

God is not offended by sincerity.

If anything, He's offended by the religious theatre
we use to avoid Him.

Truth can handle pressure.
And so can the God of truth.

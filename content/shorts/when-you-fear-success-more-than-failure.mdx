Failure is familiar.

It's disappointing, yes - but it's predictable.  
It lets you say, "At least I tried."

Success is different.

Success removes your hiding places.

Because once you succeed, you can't pretend:

- You're powerless.  
- You're unnoticed.  
- You're not capable.

Success forces accountability.

---

That's why some people sabotage.

Not because they're lazy,  
but because they're terrified of becoming visible.

Visible people get criticised.  
Visible people get watched.  
Visible people are expected to lead.

And leadership is heavier than potential.

Here's the confrontational truth:

Potential is the safest label in the world.  
It sounds impressive and demands nothing.

But you weren't made to be "full of potential."  
You were made to produce.

---

This week, stop flirting with outcomes:

- Publish the thing.  
- Apply for the role.  
- Launch the offer.  
- Make the call.

Let success reveal what needs to be refined.  
That's not humiliation.  
That's growth.

Your fear is not proof you're not ready.  
It's proof the next level is real.

Waiting can make you bitter.

Because you're not just waiting for a thing.
You're waiting for relief.

For validation.
For stability.
For the next chapter.

And it feels like God is taking His time
with your life.

But bitterness in waiting is dangerous.

It makes you interpret everything as punishment.
It makes you forget past provision.
It makes you stop praying honestly.

This week, do one mature thing:

Ask God one clean question:

"Lord, what is this season building in me?"

Then answer honestly:

- patience?
- humility?
- discipline?
- detachment?
- trust?

The waiting is not wasted
unless you waste it.

Even delays can be holy
when you stop fighting them and start learning.

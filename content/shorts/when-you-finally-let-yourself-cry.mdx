Some of you haven't cried in years.

Not because you don't feel.
But because you trained yourself
to stay composed.

You learned to survive by staying functional.

Don't resist them.

Tears are not proof you're breaking.
They're proof you're human.

They are the body doing what the soul needed to do for a long time:
release.

Tonight, if you feel it rising:

- let it happen
- don't explain it away
- don't judge it
- let God meet you there

Sometimes healing isn't loud.
Sometimes it's simply the moment you stop pretending you're fine.

And God does not despise that moment.

There is a special kind of exhaustion  
that doesn't show up on blood tests.

You're not just tired.  
You're **drained**.

Because somewhere along the way,  
"kind" quietly morphed into "available",  
and "available" quietly morphed into "owned".

It starts small:

- You reply when they *"just need a minute"*.  
- You listen when they *"just need to vent"*.  
- You fix what they *"just can't handle right now"*.

They leave lighter.  
You leave hollow.

And the irony?  
They still think you're the strong one.

Here's the uncomfortable audit:

- Who checks on you *first* - without needing something?  
- Who has actually changed because of all your advice, your support, your late-night calls?  
- Who would notice if you finally stopped rescuing them?

If those answers hurt,  
you're not cruel.  
You're finally telling yourself the truth.

**Love without boundaries is not love.**  
It's leakage.

This week:

- Say **no** once where you'd normally say "of course".  
- Leave one message **unanswered** until you genuinely have capacity.  
- Ask yourself, *"Would I let someone treat my child like this?"*  
  If the answer is no, you already know what needs to change.

You are not a bottomless well.  
You are a person.

And the people who only know how to drink  
will never teach you how to rest.  
You'll have to do that yourself.

Your childhood matters.

It shaped you.  
It trained your nervous system.  
It formed your coping patterns.

But here’s the adult reality:

If you keep using your past as a shield,  
your future will stay hostage.

Let’s be blunt:

Understanding is not transformation.

Insight is not repentance.

Naming trauma is not the same as healing it.

This week, keep the compassion —  
but add responsibility:

- What pattern do I need to stop?  
- What boundary do I need to enforce?  
- What behaviour do I need to own?

Your childhood is a chapter.

Stop letting it become the whole book.

Healing is when you stop saying,  
“This is why I’m like this,”  
and start saying,  
“This is how I’m changing.”

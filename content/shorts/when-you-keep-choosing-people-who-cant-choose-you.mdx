You keep picking the unavailable.

Not because you love pain.  
Because something in you equates pursuit with worth.

So you chase:

- mixed signals  
- half-effort  
- “I’m not ready”  
- people who only show up when it benefits them

And you call it love.

Here’s the raw truth:

If they wanted to, they would.

Not perfectly.  
Not constantly.  
But consistently.

Some of what you call “loyalty”  
is actually fear of being alone.

And some of what you call “chemistry”  
is actually anxiety — your nervous system recognising a familiar pattern.

This week, stop choosing from hunger.

Choose from honour.

- pick people who reciprocate  
- stop auditioning for care  
- stop decoding messages like a detective

Love is not confusion.

A person who can choose you  
doesn’t need to be convinced.

And you don’t need to beg  
for what should be basic.

You keep picking the unavailable.

Not because you love pain.
Because something in you equates pursuit with worth.

So you chase:

- mixed signals
- half-effort
- "I'm not ready"
- people who only show up when it benefits them

And you call it love.


{/* stripped: duplicate frontmatter block */}


Some of what you call "loyalty"
is actually fear of being alone.

And some of what you call "chemistry"
is actually anxiety - your nervous system recognising a familiar pattern.

This week, stop choosing from hunger.

Choose from honour.

- pick people who reciprocate
- stop auditioning for care
- stop decoding messages like a detective

Love is not confusion.

A person who can choose you
doesn't need to be convinced.

And you don't need to beg
for what should be basic.

Niceness is easy to sell.

It looks polite.  
It sounds gentle.

But niceness is often cowardice with good branding.

Because niceness avoids discomfort.

Goodness does not.

Goodness tells the truth:

- “This is wrong.”  
- “This is unhealthy.”  
- “This is not acceptable.”  
- “I love you, but I won’t enable you.”

Niceness says:

- “It’s fine.”  
- “Don’t worry.”  
- “Let’s not make it a thing.”

And people keep dying slowly  
while you keep protecting the mood.

Here’s the blunt truth:

If your kindness never costs you anything,  
it might not be kindness.  
It might be fear of being disliked.
---

This week, choose goodness over niceness:

- state a boundary clearly  
- tell the truth without cruelty  
- confront what needs confronting

You can be gentle  
and still be firm.

Goodness doesn’t scream.

But it does not lie.

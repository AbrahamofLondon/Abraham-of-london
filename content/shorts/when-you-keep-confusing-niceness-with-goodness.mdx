Niceness is easy to sell.

It looks polite.
It sounds gentle.

But niceness is often cowardice with good branding.

Because niceness avoids discomfort.

Goodness does not.

Here’s the blunt truth:

If your kindness never costs you anything,
it might not be kindness.
It might be fear of being disliked.

This week, choose goodness over niceness:

- state a boundary clearly
- tell the truth without cruelty
- confront what needs confronting

You can be gentle
and still be firm.

Goodness doesn’t scream.

But it does not lie.

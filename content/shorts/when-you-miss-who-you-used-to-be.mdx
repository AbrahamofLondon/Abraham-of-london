There's a version of you
from ten years ago
you secretly miss.

Not because they had more money,
or better opportunities,
but because they had something
you're not sure you still have:

Uncomplicated joy.
Reckless hope.
Trust that hadn't yet been betrayed.


{/* stripped: duplicate frontmatter block */}


Here's the strange mercy:

You're not called to go back.
You're called to become **someone new**
who carries wisdom *and* softness.

That means:

- Learning how to hope with your eyes open.
- Choosing tenderness without pretending you weren't hurt.
- Letting God heal what experience has armoured.

You don't need to resurrect the old you.
You need to meet the healed you.

Tonight:

- Write down three things you miss about that earlier version of you.
- Ask which of them were **naivety**
  and which were genuine virtues.
- Ask God to restore the virtues
  without the blindness.

You're not regressing by wanting softness back.
You're refusing to let pain be the final architect of your personality.

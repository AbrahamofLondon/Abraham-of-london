There's a version of you  
from ten years ago  
you secretly miss.

Not because they had more money,  
or better opportunities,  
but because they had something  
you're not sure you still have:

Uncomplicated joy.  
Reckless hope.  
Trust that hadn't yet been betrayed.

Life taught you things:

- How to read a room.  
- How to see red flags.  
- How to expect disappointment in advance.

You're wiser now.  
You're safer now.

You're also harder now.  
And it bothers you more than you admit.

Here's the strange mercy:

You're not called to go back.  
You're called to become **someone new**  
who carries wisdom *and* softness.

That means:

- Learning how to hope with your eyes open.  
- Choosing tenderness without pretending you weren't hurt.  
- Letting God heal what experience has armoured.

You don't need to resurrect the old you.  
You need to meet the healed you.

Tonight:

- Write down three things you miss about that earlier version of you.  
- Ask which of them were **naivety**  
  and which were genuine virtues.  
- Ask God to restore the virtues  
  without the blindness.

You're not regressing by wanting softness back.  
You're refusing to let pain be the final architect of your personality.

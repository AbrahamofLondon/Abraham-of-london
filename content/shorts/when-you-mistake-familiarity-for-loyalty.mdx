Some people have known you for a long time.
That's not the same as standing with you.

Familiarity is proximity.
Loyalty is **cost**.

Familiarity says, *"We go way back."*
Loyalty says, *"I won't leave you when it gets inconvenient."*

A loyal person doesn't just know your past.
They respect your future.

They don't compete with your growth.
They don't punish you for upgrading.
They don't act threatened when you start taking yourself seriously.

This week, run a simple test:

- Who celebrates you without needing to be included?
- Who checks on you when you're not useful?
- Who shows up consistently when nobody is watching?

Keep the ones who prove loyalty.
Release the ones who only prove familiarity.

Because some people aren't "old friends."
They're just old habits.

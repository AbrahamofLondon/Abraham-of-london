Sometimes you don’t need a new plan.  
You need an interruption.

Because your life has become one long continuation:

Same habits.  
Same patterns.  
Same compromises.

You’re not in open sin.  
You’re just in autopilot.

---

And autopilot is spiritual danger.

Not because you’re evil,  
but because you stop noticing:

- what’s dead  
- what’s drifting  
- what’s misaligned

You confuse movement with progress.

---

Here’s the hard truth:

God rarely competes with noise.

If you keep your life loud,  
you will keep missing Him  
and then blame Him for being “silent.”

---

This week, create space for interruption:

- one hour with no phone  
- one walk with no music  
- one prayer that is mostly listening

Ask one question and stop talking:

“Lord, what have I been ignoring?”

If you fear the answer, that’s a clue.

Divine interruption isn’t punishment.  
It’s rescue.

Because sometimes the most loving thing God does  
is disrupt the life you built  
so He can rebuild the life you were meant for.

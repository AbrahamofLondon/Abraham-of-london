At some point, you stopped speaking.

Not literally.  
But spiritually.

You started choosing the safest version of yourself:

- the agreeable version  
- the filtered version  
- the "don't cause trouble" version

And people liked you for it.

The cost shows up later.

You sit with yourself  
and you can't tell what you actually want.

You don't know:

- what you believe  
- what you value  
- what you even enjoy

Because your life has been one long adaptation  
to other people's expectations.

Here's the hard truth:

If your peace depends on everybody approving of you,  
you don't have peace.  
You have management.

This week, reclaim your voice in small ways:

- choose one preference without explaining it  
- say no once without guilt  
- write one page of what you actually think

Your voice may feel unfamiliar at first.  
That's normal.

You haven't lost it.  
You've just been living on mute.

And healing often begins  
the day you stop auditioning  
and start speaking like you belong to yourself.

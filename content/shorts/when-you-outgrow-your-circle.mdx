Outgrowing your circle is painful  
because it feels like betrayal.

You shared history.  
You survived together.  
You laughed in the same language.

But then you started changing.

And suddenly, the same jokes feel empty.  
The same conversations feel repetitive.  
The same habits feel heavy.

People don't always hate your growth.  
Sometimes they fear what it implies:

If you can change,  
maybe they should.

And that pressure is uncomfortable.

So instead of admitting discomfort,  
they label you:

- "You're acting different."  
- "You think you're better."  
- "You've changed."

Yes.

That's the point.

Here's the mature truth:

Not everyone is meant to go with you  
into your next chapter.

Some relationships are seasonal.  
Not because anyone is evil -  
but because the assignment changed.

This week:

- stop shrinking to keep access  
- stop apologising for growth  
- honour the past without living in it

If your circle only loves you when you're small,  
it's not community.

It's captivity with friendship language.

Bless them.  
Release them.  
And keep walking.

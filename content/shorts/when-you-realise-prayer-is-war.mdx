Some prayers are not poetic.

They’re survival.

They’re not “quiet time.”  
They’re warfare.

Because you’re not just praying for outcomes.  
You’re praying against discouragement, confusion, temptation, despair.
You are grasping for imput.

The enemy doesn’t need to destroy you publicly.

He just needs to wear you down privately  
until you stop believing anything can change.

So you get tired.

You pray less.

Then, not at all.

You settle.

Here’s the hard truth:

Some victories come  
only through stubborn persistence.

Not because God is slow,  
but because you’re being trained to stand.

This week, don’t make prayer a performance.

Make it a posture:

- pray when you don’t feel like it  
- pray briefly but consistently  
- pray specifically  
- pray with Scripture when your words run out

The battle isn’t always in your schedule.

Sometimes it’s in your spirit.

Do it until that becomes your everytime.

And the people who win long-term  
are the ones who keep praying  
when nothing looks like it’s moving.

That’s not delusion.

That’s faith under pressure.

This is the moment most people avoid.

The moment you realise  
it wasn't just them.

It was you too.

Not as a victim-blaming slogan -  
but as an adult acknowledgement:

You participated.  
You enabled.  
You avoided.  
You chose.

Here's the mature truth:

You don't heal by being right.  
You heal by being honest.

Sometimes you weren't "too kind."  
You were people-pleasing.

Sometimes you weren't "patient."  
You were afraid of conflict.

Sometimes you weren't "loyal."  
You were attached.

This week, don't spiral into shame.

Do something better: take responsibility.

- Name one pattern you brought into the mess.  
- Name one boundary you failed to enforce.  
- Name one truth you ignored.

Then change one thing.

Not with a speech.  
With a decision.

Humility isn't thinking less of yourself.  
It's refusing to lie about yourself.

And once you can tell the truth about your part,  
you can finally stop repeating it.

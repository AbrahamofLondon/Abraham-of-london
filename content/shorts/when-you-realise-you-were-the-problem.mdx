This is the moment most people avoid.

The moment you realise  
it wasn’t just them.

It was you too.

Not as a victim-blaming slogan —  
but as an adult acknowledgement:

You participated.  
You enabled.  
You avoided.  
You chose.

The ego hates this moment.

Because if you were the problem, even partially,  
then you don’t just need sympathy.

You need repentance.  
Change.  
New patterns.

And that costs pride.

Here’s the mature truth:

You don’t heal by being right.  
You heal by being honest.

Sometimes you weren’t “too kind.”  
You were people-pleasing.

Sometimes you weren’t “patient.”  
You were afraid of conflict.

Sometimes you weren’t “loyal.”  
You were attached.

This week, don’t spiral into shame.

Do something better: take responsibility.

- Name one pattern you brought into the mess.  
- Name one boundary you failed to enforce.  
- Name one truth you ignored.

Then change one thing.

Not with a speech.  
With a decision.

Humility isn’t thinking less of yourself.  
It’s refusing to lie about yourself.

And once you can tell the truth about your part,  
you can finally stop repeating it.

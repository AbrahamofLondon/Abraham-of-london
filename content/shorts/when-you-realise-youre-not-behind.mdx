You keep feeling behind.

Behind in money.  
Behind in marriage.  
Behind in career.  
Behind in life.

But behind *who*?

A curated timeline?  
A filtered photo?  
A person you’ve never actually lived with?


<!-- stripped: duplicate frontmatter block -->


Tonight, do this:

- list what you survived in the last 12 months  
- then ask: “Would I judge someone else for recovering slowly?”

Probably not.

So stop punishing yourself for being human.

You are not behind.

You are becoming.

And that takes time — the kind you can’t rush without breaking.

You keep feeling behind.

Behind in money.
Behind in marriage.
Behind in career.
Behind in life.

But behind *who*?

A curated timeline?
A filtered photo?
A person you've never actually lived with?





Tonight, do this:

- list what you survived in the last 12 months
- then ask: "Would I judge someone else for recovering slowly?"

Probably not.

So stop punishing yourself for being human.

You are not behind.

You are becoming.

And that takes time -- the kind you can't rush without breaking.

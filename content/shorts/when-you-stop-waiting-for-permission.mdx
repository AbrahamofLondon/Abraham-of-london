Waiting can be wise.

But sometimes "waiting" is just procrastination  
with a spiritual tone.

You keep saying:

- "I'm preparing."  
- "I'm praying."  
- "I'm not ready yet."

Meanwhile, years are passing.

Here's the confrontational reality:

If you need permission to pursue what you're called to do,  
you will never start.

Because people don't hand out permission for your life.  
They hand out opinions.

And opinions multiply.

At some point you have to decide:

Will I live as a son with assignment,  
or as a servant of other people's comfort?

Because the crowd will always prefer you manageable.

This week, take one permissionless step:

- publish the piece  
- launch the page  
- book the meeting  
- apply for the opportunity  
- make the ask

Not because you feel fearless.  
Because you're tired of being delayed by your own caution.

Your calling is not waiting for unanimous approval.  
It's waiting for your obedience.

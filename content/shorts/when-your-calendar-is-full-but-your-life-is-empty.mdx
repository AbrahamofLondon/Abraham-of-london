Busyness has become our armor against meaning.

We fill the hours so we don’t have to face the questions:
- What if I’m not doing what I’m meant to do?
- What if the people who need me most are getting my leftovers?
- What if I’m trading my one wild life for a to-do list?

The modern heresy is this:
We believe being needed is the same as being necessary.

You can be completely indispensable to the machinery  
and completely absent from your own story.

This week, try one act of rebellion:

- Block out **one hour** and label it “Do Not Schedule.”
- When the time comes, don’t “use it productively.”
- Sit with the discomfort of unscheduled time.
- Notice what thoughts rise up when you’re not drowning them out with tasks.

The space between appointments  
is where your life actually happens.

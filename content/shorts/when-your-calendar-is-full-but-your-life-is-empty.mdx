We don't drown in work.
We drown in *avoidance* disguised as productivity.

Filling every square on the calendar is easier than facing the quiet question underneath:

- What if I've mastered activity but lost intimacy?
- What if I'm impressive to everyone except the people who matter?
- What if I'm achieving my way into a life I no longer recognize?

Busyness is the new armour.
Silence is the new luxury.
And presence is the one thing money can't buy back.


{/* stripped: duplicate frontmatter block */}


This week, commit one sacred rebellion:

- Block **one hour** titled simply: *"Do Not Schedule."*
- Do not optimise it.
  Do not justify it.
  Do not betray it.
- Sit in the discomfort of stillness.
- Notice which thoughts follow you into the silence.

Because the life you're starving for
does not live inside your calendar.

It lives in the pauses you've been avoiding.

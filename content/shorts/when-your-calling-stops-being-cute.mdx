At first, calling feels like a vibe.

A vision board.  
A spark.  
A nice idea that makes you feel special.

Then real calling arrives.

And it's not cute.

It demands:

- discipline  
- sacrifice  
- consistency  
- uncomfortable obedience

And suddenly you're tempted to back away.

Because you wanted inspiration, not assignment.

Here's the grown-up truth:

Calling is proven in the boring.

The days you don't feel gifted.  
The weeks you don't feel seen.  
The seasons where nothing is trending.

This week, stop romanticising your calling.

Treat it like a mandate.

- schedule the work  
- build the system  
- show up when it's quiet

Because God doesn't entrust influence  
to people who only move when it feels exciting.

The calling isn't cute.

It's costly.

And that cost is the price of becoming.

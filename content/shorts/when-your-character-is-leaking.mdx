Character doesn’t collapse in one day.

It leaks.

A little dishonesty.  
A little excuse.  
A little rationalisation.

Nothing dramatic —  
just enough to keep you comfortable.

---

Leaks look like:

- “It’s not that serious.”  
- “I deserved it.”  
- “Nobody got hurt.”  
- “I’ll fix it later.”

And later never comes.

Because compromise doesn’t just change outcomes.  
It changes **you**.

Here’s the leadership reality:

People don’t follow what you claim.  
They follow what you consistently are.

And eventually, whatever you’re hiding  
will surface as:

- disrespect  
- instability  
- confusion  
- quiet self-contempt

You can’t lead people past a point  
you refuse to lead yourself.

---

This week, locate one leak:

- one lie you keep telling yourself  
- one habit that’s eroding you  
- one area where your values don’t govern your behaviour

Then do something adult:

Fix it.

Not with a speech.  
With a decision.

Because charisma can cover leaks for a while.  
But pressure exposes everything.

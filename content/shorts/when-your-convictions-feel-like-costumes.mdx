There comes a moment - quiet, dangerous, holy -  
when you realize you've been living as the public version of yourself.

You still say all the right things.  
You still preach the values you inherited.  
But in the unguarded moments, they feel borrowed.

It starts with tiny compromises:

- "Just this once."
- "Everyone else does it."
- "It doesn't really matter."

But compromise compounds.  
And one morning you look at your reflection  
and see a stranger wearing your convictions like theatre clothes.

Here is the mercy in the discomfort:

**The gap is not your enemy.  
Pretending there is no gap is.**

Every honest person lives somewhere between  
who they are  
and who they meant to be.

The hypocrite isn't the one who stumbles.  
The hypocrite is the one who performs righteousness  
instead of pursuing it.

This week, trade performance for truth:

- Identify **one belief** that feels like a costume.  
- Ask: *"Do I believe this... or do I just like the applause it gets me?"*
- If the answer embarrasses you, good.  
  That's the beginning of integrity, not the end of it.

Better three convictions you actually live  
than thirty you only display.

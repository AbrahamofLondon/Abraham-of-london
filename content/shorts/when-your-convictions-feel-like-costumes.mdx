There’s a distance that grows  
between what you profess and what you practice.

It starts small:
- A principle you compromise “just this once”
- A boundary you move “for now”
- A standard you lower “because everyone else does”

Then one day you look in the mirror  
and don’t recognize the person wearing your beliefs.

The gap isn’t the problem.  
**Hiding from the gap** is.

Every honest person lives with some distance  
between their ideals and their actions.

The hypocrite isn’t the one who falls short.  
The hypocrite is the one who pretends they don’t.

Instead of trying to close the gap overnight:

- Identify **one belief** that feels most like a costume right now.
- Ask yourself: “Do I actually believe this,  
  or do I just like how it sounds when I say it?”
- If it’s the latter, give yourself permission  
  to stop saying it until you mean it.

It’s better to have three convictions you actually live by  
than thirty you just wear for show.

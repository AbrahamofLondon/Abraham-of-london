Nobody told you  
that answered prayers come with maintenance fees.

You wanted impact.  
You wanted reach.  
You wanted to break patterns  
and build something that outlives you.

Now your dreams sit on your chest at night  
like a responsibility you're not sure you can carry.

Here's the quiet reality:

- Big dreams expose small systems.  
- Big callings expose fragile character.  
- Big visions expose unhealed motivations.

It's not that the dream is wrong.  
It's that it's **revealing** you.

That's mercy, even if it doesn't feel like it.

The temptation is to either:

1. **Shrink the dream** until it stops stretching you.  
2. **Perform the dream** publicly while collapsing privately.

There is a third option:  
Grow the **person** who is carrying it.

That means:

- Letting God dismantle your saviour complex.  
- Learning boring disciplines: sleep, planning, boundaries.  
- Admitting you can't do this on raw talent and adrenaline.

This week, instead of fantasising about the future:

- Name one habit that would make you ready for it.  
- Remove one weight you were never meant to carry alone.  
- Ask for help where pride has kept you silent.

You're not weak because your dream feels heavy.  
You're human.

And the dream was never designed  
to be carried by a performance version of you.  
Only the real you can steward it.

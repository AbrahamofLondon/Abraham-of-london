Nobody told you
that answered prayers come with maintenance fees.

You wanted impact.
You wanted reach.
You wanted to break patterns
and build something that outlives you.

Now your dreams sit on your chest at night
like a responsibility you're not sure you can carry.





The temptation is to either:

1. **Shrink the dream** until it stops stretching you.
2. **Perform the dream** publicly while collapsing privately.

There is a third option:
Grow the **person** who is carrying it.

That means:

- Letting God dismantle your saviour complex.
- Learning boring disciplines: sleep, planning, boundaries.
- Admitting you can't do this on raw talent and adrenaline.

This week, instead of fantasising about the future:

- Name one habit that would make you ready for it.
- Remove one weight you were never meant to carry alone.
- Ask for help where pride has kept you silent.

You're not weak because your dream feels heavy.
You're human.

And the dream was never designed
to be carried by a performance version of you.
Only the real you can steward it.

There are days when you don't doubt God.  
You just don't feel **anything**.

The songs don't land.  
The verses feel flat.  
Everyone else looks "on fire"  
and you're doing well just to show up as a functioning human.

Let's name it plainly:

You are not a machine.  
You are not a 24/7 worship stream.  
You are a human being with a nervous system, a history, and limits.

## 1. Numbness is not proof you've failed

Numbness usually means **overload**, not rebellion.

Too many decisions.  
Too many tabs open - in your browser and in your soul.  
Too many hits taken without time to heal between them.

Your faith hasn't died.  
It's just protecting itself by going quiet.

## 2. You don't have to fake warmth you don't feel

You don't fix numbness by pretending to be "on fire".

You fix numbness by doing the most honest thing you can do:

> "God, I feel nothing.  
> I don't even know what to say.  
> But I'm here."

That's not weak.  
That's **alignment**.

## 3. Small, repeatable moves beat heroic gestures

When your faith feels numb, don't promise a 40-day fast.

Do this instead:

- One honest sentence to God a day.  
- One paragraph of something true, not trendy.  
- One act of kindness nobody sees.

Tiny, repeatable moves.  
Slowly, they tell your soul:  
"**We're still in this.**"
---

You don't have to manufacture a feeling.  
You just have to keep turning, even slightly, in the right direction.

The fire will not always be this dim.  
But even when it is, it's still **fire**.

Let it warm your soul.

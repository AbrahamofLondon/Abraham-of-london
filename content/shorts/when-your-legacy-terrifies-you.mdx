A real legacy is not a quote on a wall.

It's weight.

It means your life affects people.  
Your choices echo.  
Your discipline becomes someone else's permission.

And that's terrifying  
if you're still negotiating your own maturity.

Legacy scares you because it exposes the gap:

You want significance,  
but you also want comfort.

You want influence,  
but you also want privacy.

You want greatness,  
but you still want to be allowed to coast.

Here's the leadership truth:

Your future requires a version of you  
that your current habits cannot support.

So the fear is not irrational.  
It's accurate.

It's warning you: "You need to grow."

This week, don't chase "legacy."

Chase integrity.

- Fix one habit that undermines your future.  
- Build one discipline that your children (literal or spiritual) would respect.  
- Stop negotiating the basics.

Legacy is not built by big moments.  
It's built by who you are  
when nobody is clapping.

If your legacy terrifies you, good.  
It means you're finally taking your life seriously.

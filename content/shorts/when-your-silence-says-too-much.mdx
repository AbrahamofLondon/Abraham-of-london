Some people are loud when they're hurt.

Others go quiet.

Some of us do either of both, depending on the context.

Not because they're mature -  
but because they've learned that talking won't change anything.

So they stop.

Silence can be wisdom.  
It can also be surrender.

When your silence becomes a lifestyle, it often means:

- You don't expect accountability.  
- You don't expect repair.  
- You've accepted being misunderstood as normal.

You learned to "keep the peace"  
because you were punished for having needs.

Here's the hard truth:

If you can't speak honestly in a relationship,  
you're not in a relationship.  
You're in a performance.

You're managing someone else's comfort  
at the cost of your own truth.

This week, try one small honesty:

- "When you did that, it affected me."  
- "I need you to take this seriously."  
- "I'm not okay, and I don't want to pretend."

If they dismiss you, note it.

Because your silence isn't the issue.  
It's the environment that made your voice feel unsafe.

And you don't heal by becoming quieter.  
You heal by becoming true.

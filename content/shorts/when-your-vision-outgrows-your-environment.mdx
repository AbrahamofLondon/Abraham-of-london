At first, your environment felt like home.

Then your vision started to expand
and suddenly the same room feels cramped.

People call you "changed."
But what they really mean is:
you stopped shrinking.

Here's the hard line:

If your environment punishes your growth,
it is not a home.
It is a cage with good memories.

This week:

- Stop asking permission from people who fear your future.
- Find one community - even online - where expansion is normal.
- Take one action that aligns with your bigger vision, not your smaller setting.

Your environment isn't evil.
It's just not built for who you're becoming.

And you can honour where you came from
without living there forever.

At first, your environment felt like home.

Then your vision started to expand  
and suddenly the same room feels cramped.

People call you "changed."  
But what they really mean is:  
you stopped shrinking.

---
Outgrowing an environment is lonely.

Because your growth becomes inconvenient for people  
who benefited from your smallness.

They'll say:

- "Who do you think you are?"  
- "You're doing too much."  
- "Be content."

Sometimes they even spiritualise your ceiling.

But your calling doesn't fit inside their comfort.

---

Here's the hard line:

If your environment punishes your growth,  
it is not a home.  
It is a cage with good memories.

---

This week:

- Stop asking permission from people who fear your future.  
- Find one community - even online - where expansion is normal.  
- Take one action that aligns with your bigger vision, not your smaller setting.

Your environment isn't evil.  
It's just not built for who you're becoming.

And you can honour where you came from  
without living there forever.

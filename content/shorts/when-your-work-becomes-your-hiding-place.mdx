Work is clean.

Work is measurable.  
Work gives you a score.

If life feels chaotic,  
work is a place you can control.

So you go there - again and again.

Not just to succeed.  
To hide.

When work becomes your hiding place, you'll notice:

- you feel anxious on weekends  
- you don't know how to be still  
- your identity collapses when you're not "achieving"

And you call it ambition.

But some of it is fear.

Because if you slow down,  
you'll have to face:

- grief  
- loneliness  
- conflict  
- disappointment  
- the quiet question: "Is this all?"

Here's the raw truth:

If your work is the only place you feel valuable,  
you're not free.

You're employed by your own insecurity.

This week, do something rebellious:

- finish work, then stop  
- don't "just check" the email  
- sit with yourself long enough to hear what's real

Work is a gift.  
But it's a terrible refuge.

And one day, if you don't build a home inside your soul,  
you'll keep building careers as shelters -
until you collapse inside the very thing you use to escape.

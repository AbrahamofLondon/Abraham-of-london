Work is clean.

Work is measurable.
Work gives you a score.

If life feels chaotic,
work is a place you can control.

So you go there - again and again.

Not just to succeed.
To hide.

Here's the raw truth:

If your work is the only place you feel valuable,
you're not free.

You're employed by your own insecurity.

This week, do something rebellious:

- finish work, then stop
- don't "just check" the email
- sit with yourself long enough to hear what's real

Work is a gift.
But it's a terrible refuge.

And one day, if you don't build a home inside your soul,
you'll keep building careers as shelters -
until you collapse inside the very thing you use to escape.

Distraction is socially acceptable addiction.

Nobody stages an intervention for scrolling.  
They just call it "normal."

But normal doesn't mean healthy.


<!-- stripped: duplicate frontmatter block -->


Here's the hard truth:

If you can't sit quietly with yourself,  
you're not free.

You're managed by impulses.

And the world loves that,  
because distracted people are easy to sell to.

This week, practice one small detox:

- 20 minutes per day with no phone  
- a walk without headphones  
- one meal without a screen

Your attention is not trivial.  
It's your life in currency form.

And if you keep spending it on distraction,  
you will wake up one day  
with a life you never actually lived.

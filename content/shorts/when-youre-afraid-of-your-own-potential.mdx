Some people fear failing.  
You secretly fear **proving yourself right**.

Because if you are as capable  
as your spirit keeps hinting,  
then you can no longer hide behind:

- "No one ever gave me a chance."  
- "Maybe I'm just average."  
- "It's not that deep."

Success would expose you.  
It would demand things from you  
laziness and fear currently protect you from.

So you do this quiet dance:

- Start, but never finish.  
- Prepare, but never launch.  
- Dream loudly, act slowly.

That way, your potential stays theoretical.  
And theoretical potential is safe.  
It can't be measured.  
It can't be judged.

The uncomfortable truth:

You're not stuck because of a lack of clarity.  
You're stuck because of a lack of **decision**.

At some point you will have to choose:

- Do I want the comfort of my current story?  
- Or the responsibility of the version of me  
  I know I could become?

Both are costly.  
Only one is worthy.

This week, do something that commits you:

- Pay for the course.  
- Announce the date.  
- Send the email.  
- Apply for the role.

Make a move your future self will be forced to steward.

You are not afraid of failure.  
You're afraid that heaven's opinion of you  
might actually be accurate.

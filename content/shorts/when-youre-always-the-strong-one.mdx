Being the strong one starts as survival.

You learn to cope.  
You learn to carry weight.  
You learn to function through pain.

And people admire it.

Then they begin to expect it.

Here's the raw truth:

Some people love you  
because you make life easier for them.

Not because they cherish you,  
but because they consume you.

And you keep accepting it  
because being needed feels like being valued.

This week, disrupt the pattern:

- Ask someone for help with something small.  
- Admit you're not okay without explaining it away.  
- Stop rescuing people who refuse to grow.

Real strength is not constant carrying.  
It's knowing when to put the load down.

If nobody makes space for your humanity,  
that's not community.  
That's exploitation with a smile.

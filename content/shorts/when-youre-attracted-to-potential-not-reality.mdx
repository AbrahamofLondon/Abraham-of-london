Some of you don’t date people.

You date potential.

You don’t fall for their character —  
you fall for your own imagination.

You see:

- “If they healed…”  
- “If they matured…”  
- “If they understood me…”  
- “If they stopped doing that…”

And you call it love.

Here’s the hard truth:

Potential is not a person.  
It’s a project.

And when you build your heart on potential,  
you sign up for endless disappointment.

Because you’re expecting them to become  
what they’ve shown no consistent desire to be.

Love requires honesty.

Not fantasy.

Reality says:

- Are they consistent?  
- Do they honour you?  
- Do their habits match their words?  
- Do they take responsibility?

If not, your “hope” is not virtue.  
It’s self-deception.

This week, choose reality:

- stop negotiating red flags  
- stop calling inconsistency “complexity”  
- stop treating basic effort like a miracle

You don’t need someone with potential.

You need someone with character.

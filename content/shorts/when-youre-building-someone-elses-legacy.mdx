Most of us inherit our ambitions long before we ever question them.

We borrow dreams like hand-me-down clothes:
- The respectable career
- The sensible path
- The version of success our culture hands out like a template

And because the people who gave us the blueprint loved us,
we never stopped to ask if it was **ours**.

Before you take the next "logical step":

- Write down **three pursuits** you inherited, absorbed, or obeyed.
- Ask the dangerous question:
  *"If no one would be disappointed, would I still want this?"*
- The answers will feel rebellious.
  Let them.

Your life is not an heirloom.
It's uncharted territory.

And God did not put you here to maintain someone else's map.

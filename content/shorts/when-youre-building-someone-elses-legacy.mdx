We inherit our ambitions like family silver:
- The career path we "should" take
- The version of success we're "supposed to" want
- The life we're "expected to" build

And for years, we don't question it  
because the blueprint came from people who love us.

But love and wisdom are not the same thing.

Someone can love you deeply  
and still give you a map to the wrong destination.

---

The most painful realization isn't that you're lost.  
It's that you're **efficiently** traveling in the wrong direction.

You're hitting all the milestones  
on a journey you never chose.

---

Before you take the next "logical step":

- Write down **three things** you're currently pursuing  
  because someone else believes in them.
- For each one, ask: “If no one would be disappointed,  
  would I still care about this?”
- For the ones where the answer is no,  
  give yourself permission to at least **question** them.

Your life is not an inheritance to manage.  
It's a country to explore.

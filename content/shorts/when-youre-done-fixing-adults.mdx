There's a moment every helper reaches
when kindness starts to feel like self-harm.

You've explained it.
Encouraged them.
Prayed for them.
Sent the resources.
Taken the calls.

And still - nothing changes.





This is your permission:

Stop rescuing grown people from grown decisions.

You are not their saviour.
You are not their parent.
You are not their rehabilitation centre.

This week, draw one line:

- "I can't keep having this same conversation."
- "I'm not available for that."
- "I love you, but I'm stepping back."

If they get angry, don't panic.
Anger is often the first response
when access is revoked.

You're not becoming cold.
You're becoming free.

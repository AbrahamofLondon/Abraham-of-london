There's a moment every helper reaches  
when kindness starts to feel like self-harm.

You've explained it.  
Encouraged them.  
Prayed for them.  
Sent the resources.  
Taken the calls.

And still - nothing changes.

Here's the truth you keep avoiding:

Some people don't want help.  
They want relief.

They don't want transformation.  
They want comfort.

And they will keep you around  
as long as you're willing to cushion their consequences.

This is your permission:

Stop rescuing grown people from grown decisions.

You are not their saviour.  
You are not their parent.  
You are not their rehabilitation centre.

This week, draw one line:

- "I can't keep having this same conversation."  
- "I'm not available for that."  
- "I love you, but I'm stepping back."

If they get angry, don't panic.  
Anger is often the first response  
when access is revoked.

You're not becoming cold.  
You're becoming free.

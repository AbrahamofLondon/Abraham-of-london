There's a version of you
that only comes out when you're alone.

Not the productive one.
Not the "I've got it" one.
The one who sits on the edge of the bed
and stares into nothing.

That version of you is not lazy.
They're **done**.


{/* stripped: duplicate frontmatter block */}


Let's call it what it is:

If you collapsed tomorrow,
they'd find a replacement.

If you burned out completely,
the group chat would send emojis and move on.

You are building a life
where you are the only non-renewable resource
and the only one not on your own priority list.

This week, do something outrageous:

- Leave one message on **read**.
- Cancel one non-essential commitment with:
  *"I don't have the capacity right now."*
- Go to bed when your body says "sleep",
  not when your guilt says "you're allowed".

The world will not end.
The group will not fall apart.

And if someone resents your humanity,
they were never honouring your presence -
just consuming your availability.

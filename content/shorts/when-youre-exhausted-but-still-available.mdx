There’s a version of you  
that only comes out when you’re alone.

Not the productive one.  
Not the “I’ve got it” one.  
The one who sits on the edge of the bed  
and stares into nothing.

That version of you is not lazy.  
They’re **done**.

But exhaustion in our world  
is not a warning sign.  
It’s a badge.

You still answer messages quickly.  
You still say, *“It’s fine, I’ve got it.”*  
You still show up for events  
your soul left three months ago.

Because in your head,  
“resting” still sounds like “failing”.

Let’s call it what it is:

If you collapsed tomorrow,  
they’d find a replacement.

If you burned out completely,  
the group chat would send emojis and move on.

You are building a life  
where you are the only non-renewable resource  
and the only one not on your own priority list.

This week, do something outrageous:

- Leave one message on **read**.  
- Cancel one non-essential commitment with:  
  *“I don’t have the capacity right now.”*  
- Go to bed when your body says “sleep”,  
  not when your guilt says “you’re allowed”.

The world will not end.  
The group will not fall apart.

And if someone resents your humanity,  
they were never honouring your presence —  
just consuming your availability.

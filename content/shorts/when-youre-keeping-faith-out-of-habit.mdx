There's a phase of faith that nobody romanticises.

You still attend.  
Still pray.  
Still say the right words.

But inside, it feels... flat.

Like you're doing faith the way you brush your teeth:  
because you're supposed to.

Habit is not sin.  
But it can become a hiding place.

When faith becomes routine, we can:

- avoid honesty with God  
- avoid questions we're scared to ask  
- avoid the grief we never processed

So we keep the motions  
and quietly lose the relationship.

Here's the uncomfortable invitation:

God can handle your honesty.

Not your polished lines.  
Not your rehearsed gratitude.

Your real sentence:  
"I don't feel You."  
"I'm tired."  
"I don't understand."  
"I'm disappointed."

That is not rebellion.  
That is relationship.

This week:

- Pray one prayer without religious language.  
- Read one Psalm that tells the truth without apology.  
- Sit for five minutes and stop performing.

Faith isn't proven by constant intensity.  
It's proven by refusal to fake it.

Habit can keep you near.  
Honesty brings you back alive.

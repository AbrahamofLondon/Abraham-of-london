Weekends shouldn't feel like oxygen.

If Monday feels like suffocation,
that's not "adult life."

That's misalignment.





This week, don't quit everything impulsively.

Do something smarter:

- locate one daily joy (small, consistent, real)
- adjust one boundary at work
- reclaim one hour of your day for your soul

If your whole life is a countdown to Friday,
you don't need a vacation.

You need a redesign.

Because your life is not meant to be 5/7 suffering.

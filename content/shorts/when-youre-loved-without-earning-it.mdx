Some love makes you nervous.

Not because it’s fake —  
because it’s clean.

It doesn’t demand performance.  
It doesn’t manipulate.  
It doesn’t punish you for being human.

And you don’t know what to do with that.
---

When you’ve had to earn love,  
free love feels suspicious.

You keep waiting for the invoice.

You keep thinking:

“What do they want?”
---

This is your reminder:

Not all love is a transaction.

Some people will love you  
because they actually see you.

Not your productivity.  
Not your usefulness.  
You.
---

If that kind of love finds you, don’t sabotage it.

Receive it slowly.

Let it retrain your nervous system.

And let it remind you  
that you were never created  
to earn your worth.

We live in an age where you can track:
- How many words you wrote
- How many people scrolled past
- How many hours you burned

But nobody has built an app that measures:
- How much closer you are to the person you want to become
- How much truth you told today
- How much courage you actually needed

Here’s the uncomfortable truth:

What gets measured gets managed.  
And we’re managing the wrong things.

We’re optimizing for visibility  
when we should be optimizing for substance.

Tonight, before you close your laptop:

- Write down **one thing** you did today that felt meaningful.  
  Not productive. Meaningful.
- Don’t share it. Don’t post it.  
  Just notice the difference in how it feels to write it down.

The most important things in your life  
will never fit in a spreadsheet.

Some seasons feel like nothing is happening.

No applause.
No visible progress.
Just quiet work and quiet waiting.

And you start wondering if you missed your moment.

Here's what people forget:

Rooms you pray to enter
often require a version of you
that doesn't exist yet.

Not because God is cruel,
but because access without capacity
becomes disaster.

This week, stop despising preparation:

- Treat your current responsibility like it's sacred.
- Tighten your craft.
- Clean up what your future can't afford to carry.

When the door opens,
you won't have time to become ready.

And when you finally enter that room,
you'll realise the waiting wasn't wasted -
it was shaping.

You can be productive  
and still be absent.

Your body is in the room,  
but your mind is on the next task.

You eat while scrolling.  
You talk while replying.  
You rest while feeling guilty.

Here's the hard audit:

Can you remember three moments from yesterday  
that you actually *felt*?

Not performed.  
Not documented.  
Felt.

If you can't, you're not failing at work.  
You're failing at presence.

This week, practice one act of attention:

- drink tea slowly with no phone  
- take a walk and notice the air  
- listen to someone without preparing your reply

Presence is not laziness.  
It's stewardship.

Because a life you cannot feel  
will never become meaningful -  
no matter how impressive it looks on paper.

Starting over threatens your pride.

Because it forces you to admit
the old plan didn't work.

You can tolerate pain.
But embarrassment? That's harder.

Here's the real fear:

Starting over means you can't blame the past anymore.
It means you have to build.

And building requires vulnerability.

This week:

- Choose one small restart: one habit, one boundary, one honest decision.
- Stop waiting for "confidence."
- Take action while afraid.

Starting over isn't childish.
It's brave.

Sometimes the most mature thing you can do
is admit you were in the wrong room
and leave with your dignity intact.

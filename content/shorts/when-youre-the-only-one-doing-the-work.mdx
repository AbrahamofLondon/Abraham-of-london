There's a kind of fatigue
that only comes from one-sided effort.

You initiate.
You apologise.
You explain.
You repair.

And they… receive.





Here's the hard truth:

Love doesn't require you to beg for basic effort.

Reciprocity is not a luxury.
It's the minimum.

If you have to keep proving your value,
you're dealing with someone
who likes being loved
more than they like loving.

This week, pull back slightly.

Not to punish them.
To reveal the truth.

Stop doing one thing you always do.

If the relationship collapses
when you stop carrying it,
you didn't lose love.

You lost a burden.

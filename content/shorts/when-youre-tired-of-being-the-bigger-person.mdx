"Be the bigger person."

Translation:  
*"Absorb the hit so everyone else can stay comfortable."*

You've done it for years.

You apologise first.  
You compromise first.  
You fold yourself into shapes  
that keep everyone else from having to grow.

And people call you "gracious".  
You quietly call yourself "tired".

Let's be clear:

- Forgiveness is holy.  
- Emotional labour is not.

When being "the bigger person" means  
carrying the full weight of someone else's refusal to mature,  
that's not virtue.  
That's self-abandonment.

Ask yourself:

- Who benefits most from you "rising above it"?  
- Who never has to face their behaviour  
  because you always take the high road?  
- Who would finally feel the consequences  
  if you stopped covering for them?

Sometimes the most spiritual thing you can do  
is **stop shielding adults from the results of their own choices**.

This week, try a different kind of maturity:

- Don't send the smoothing text.  
- Don't chase the person who disrespected you.  
- Don't explain the boundary twelve times.

You're not required to play saviour  
in relationships where people crucify you  
and call it your calling.

Being the bigger person doesn't mean shrinking yourself.  
Sometimes it means walking away at your full height.

Starting over is exhausting.

Not the motivational kind.  
The humiliating kind.

The kind where you’re older now,  
wiser now,  
and still rebuilding what you thought would be stable by now.


<!-- stripped: duplicate frontmatter block -->


But there’s a danger in constant restarting:

You start to resent your own life.

You begin to think:

- “Maybe I’m cursed.”  
- “Maybe I’m behind.”  
- “Maybe nothing lasts for me.”

That thinking is poison.

This week, don’t romanticise resilience.

Just do this:

- honour how far you’ve come  
- stop insulting your own endurance  
- build one small stable routine you can keep

Sometimes starting over isn’t proof you’re broken.

Sometimes it’s proof you refused to die.

And that refusal matters more than you think.

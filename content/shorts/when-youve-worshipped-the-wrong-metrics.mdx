Metrics are useful.

But if you’re not careful,  
they become gods.

You start living for numbers:

- followers  
- income  
- titles  
- wins  
- applause

And you ignore what can’t be graphed:

- peace  
- integrity  
- family  
- character  
- devotion

Here’s the raw truth:

If your life looks successful but feels hollow,  
you didn’t fail.

You just measured the wrong thing.

You ran the wrong scoreboard.

Some people don’t lose their lives through sin.  
They lose their lives through optimisation.

They become efficient at everything  
except being whole.

This week, create new metrics:

- Did I live honestly today?  
- Did I do what I said I would do?  
- Did I love people without using them?  
- Did I obey God in small things?

If your numbers are up  
but your soul is down,  
that’s not growth.

That’s drift.

Fix the metric,  
or the metric will finish you.

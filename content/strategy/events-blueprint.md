# Abraham of London — Events Blueprint (Rolling 1–5 Year Plan)

**Principle:** Clarity, Capital, Character
**Room standard:** Chatham (off the record)
**Design:** Small rooms, high trust, practical standards

---

## Pillars (Event Types)

1. **Salon** — curated conversation; 12–16 seats; 90 minutes
2. **Workshop** — working session; 12–16 seats; 2–3 hours
3. **Briefing** — principal update; 30–45 minutes; remote or in-room
4. **Retreat** — 1–2 day deep work; 8–12 principals
5. **Community** — invite-only dinners, stewardship forums

---

## Definition of Success

> **The Abraham Standard:** A Principal leaves the room and implements **one structural decision within 7 days** that generates non-negotiable capital (financial, relational, or spiritual), increasing internal clarity and external credibility.

---

## Annual Themes & Quarterly Arcs

* **Standards Council (Curatorial Board):** 1–2 named principals approve the **Annual Theme** and curatorial standards.
* **Yearly theme (1)** sets tone (e.g., *Enduring Enterprise*).
* **Quarter arcs (4)**: *Clarity → Capital → Cadence → Character*.
* **IP Development Map (replaces “Library alignment”):** Each quarter produces **2–3 assets** (pre-reads, notes, frameworks, or white papers) that compound into durable IP.

---

## Segmentation & Access (Solve the HNW Tradeoff)

**Two Financial Tracks**

* **Principal Track:** Access bundled in an **Annual Advisory Retainer**.
* **Guest Track:** Paid, tiered access *(guide rails)*

  * Workshop: **£500–£1,500**
  * Briefing: **£0–£200**
  * Retreat: **£5,000+**

**Fellowship Seats (1–2 per room)**

* **Invite-only, fully subsidised**, nominated by a Principal/Partner.
* Signals potential, not status; protects the room while developing up-and-comers.
* **Conversion KPI:** Fellowship → **Paid Advisory Pilot**.

**Social Contract (beyond Chatham)**

* **No cold pitches.** Purpose is peer learning + collaboration.
* **Device policy:** silent; no photos or posts.
* **No sponsorship logos in room.** Co-hosts by Principal approval only.

---

## Capacity & Cadence

* **Quarterly minimum:** 1 Salon, 1 Workshop, 1 Briefing
* **Seat guardrails:** 12–16 seats; **85%+ attendance** target
* **Quality bar:** **NPS ≥ 9.0**, **80% “actionable within 7 days”**

---

## Governance (RACI)

**Roles**

* **Principal (A):** Approves themes, standards, guests
* **Program Director (R/A):** Calendar, OKRs, budget, QA
* **Content Lead (R):** Briefs, MDX, frameworks, run-of-show
* **Ops Lead (R):** Venue, invites, comms, hospitality
* **Partnerships (C):** Co-hosts, tightly guardrailed
* **Stewardship (R):** Post-room follow-up, advisory pipeline

**Decisions**

* Themes & pillars — *Principal, Director*
* Room list — *Principal & Director*, privacy check by *Ops*
* Budget, venues — *Director*
* Standards (Chatham, devices, social contract) — *Principal*

---

## Cadences (Elevated)

* **Annual (Q4):** **Executive Readiness Briefing**; theme, budget, pillar targets (board pack)
* **Quarterly (Q-1):** Room selection; **IP Development Map**; outreach plan
* **Monthly:** **Portfolio Risk Assessment**; stewardship pipeline; run-sheet QA
* **Weekly (8-week runway):** Checklist burn-down; confirmations
* **48–72 hrs pre:** **Final Vetting & Room Orchestration**; Principal-specific **Briefing Pack**; seating chart
* **<24 hrs:** Principal brief; **Ops Pack**; materials printed
* **+24 hrs post:** **Chatham Post-Mortem (de-identified)**; NPS; stewardship activations; repo updates

---

## Guardrails (Budget & Quality)

* **Cost per seat (target / ceiling):**

  * **Workshop:** £90 / £140
  * **Salon:** £60 / £100
* **Net margin:** Breakeven on room; **margin from advisory/follow-on**
* **No sponsorship logos** in room; co-hosts by Principal approval only

---

## KPIs (per quarter)

* Attendance rate ≥ **85%**
* NPS ≥ **9.0**
* “Actionable within 7 days” ≥ **80%**
* **Fellowship Conversion:** ≥ **X%** move to **Paid Advisory Pilot**

---

## 1–5 Year Milestones (Rolling)

* Stewardship CRM, referral flywheel, materials index/search

**Year 3 — Syndicate & Partners**

* 2–3 **aligned co-hosts** (carefully curated)
* **Fellowship cohort** (6–8 leaders; 6-month cadence)

**Year 4 — Institute**

* “**Standards & Stewardship Institute**” brand; curriculum map
* Signature retreat; **de-identified case compendium**

**Year 5 — Legacy**

---

## Tools & Technology (Seamless, discreet)

* **CRM:** All guest history, NPS, advisory pipeline (Salesforce/HubSpot/custom)
* **Comms/Invites:** White-label via **Resend**; encrypted list management; no Mailchimp
* **RSVP/Seating:** Internal tool or lightweight CMS + protected forms
* **Post-Room Archive:** Password/token-gated (Netlify Edge / middleware) for attendees only
* **Analytics:** Minimal, privacy-respecting; event-level KPIs only
* **Repo automation:** Build hooks generate PDFs; validation scripts enforce naming & covers

---

## IP & Materials (Authoritative)

* **Pre-Read:** Standardised **2-page Foundational Brief** (terms, frames, debate scope)
* **In-Room:** One-page **Run-of-Show**; printable cue sheets
* **Post-Room:** **Chatham Post-Mortem (de-identified)** + **Action Standards** one-pager
* **Library:** `/public/downloads/*.pdf` with cover images under `/assets/images/downloads/`

---

## Risk & Controls

* **Privacy breach:** Guest NDA; Chatham brief; device policy; small rooms
* **Quality drift:** Peer review; content checklist; post-mortems
* **Over-extension:** Fixed cadence; **no ad-hoc rooms** without Director approval
* **Partner misfit:** Values screen; **Principal veto** right

---

## Event Brief Template (single page)

* **Title, Pillar, Date, Location, Seats (target / cap)**
* **Purpose (3 lines)**, **Desired Outcomes (bullets)**
* **20-min arc** (timeline), **Roles & RACI**
* **Guest list v1 (owner)**; **Fellowship nominees (sponsor/principal)**
* **Pre-read (links)**; **Materials** (notes + PDF filenames)
* **Social Contract highlights:** Chatham, **No Cold Pitch**, device policy
* **Stewardship plan:** who calls whom by when

# Abraham of London Ã¢â‚¬â€ Events Blueprint (Rolling 1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ5 Year Plan)

**Principle:** Clarity, Capital, Character
**Room standard:** Chatham (off the record)
**Design:** Small rooms, high trust, practical standards

---

## Pillars (Event Types)

1. **Salon** Ã¢â‚¬â€ curated conversation; 12Ã¢â‚¬â€œ16 seats; 90 minutes
2. **Workshop** Ã¢â‚¬â€ working session; 12Ã¢â‚¬â€œ16 seats; 2Ã¢â‚¬â€œ3 hours
3. **Briefing** Ã¢â‚¬â€ principal update; 30Ã¢â‚¬â€œ45 minutes; remote or in-room
4. **Retreat** Ã¢â‚¬â€ 1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2 day deep work; 8Ã¢â‚¬â€œ12 principals
5. **Community** Ã¢â‚¬â€ invite-only dinners, stewardship forums

---

## Definition of Success

> **The Abraham Standard:** A Principal leaves the room and implements **one structural decision within 7 days** that generates non-negotiable capital (financial, relational, or spiritual), increasing internal clarity and external credibility.

---

## Annual Themes & Quarterly Arcs

* **Standards Council (Curatorial Board):** 1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2 named principals approve the **Annual Theme** and curatorial standards.
* **Yearly theme (1)** sets tone (e.g., *Enduring Enterprise*).
* **Quarter arcs (4)**: *Clarity Ã¢â€ â€™ Capital Ã¢â€ â€™ Cadence Ã¢â€ â€™ Character*.
* **IP Development Map (replaces Ã¢â‚¬Å“Library alignmentÃ¢â‚¬Â):** Each quarter produces **2Ã¢â‚¬â€œ3 assets** (pre-reads, notes, frameworks, or white papers) that compound into durable IP.

---

## Segmentation & Access (Solve the HNW Tradeoff)

**Two Financial Tracks**

* **Principal Track:** Access bundled in an **Annual Advisory Retainer**.

  * Workshop: **Ã‚Â£500Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Â£1,500**
  * Briefing: **Ã‚Â£0Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Â£200**
  * Retreat: **Ã‚Â£5,000+**

**Fellowship Seats (1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2 per room)**

* **Invite-only, fully subsidised**, nominated by a Principal/Partner.
* Signals potential, not status; protects the room while developing up-and-comers.
* **Conversion KPI:** Fellowship Ã¢â€ â€™ **Paid Advisory Pilot**.

**Social Contract (beyond Chatham)**

* **No cold pitches.** Purpose is peer learning + collaboration.
* **Device policy:** silent; no photos or posts.
* **No sponsorship logos in room.** Co-hosts by Principal approval only.

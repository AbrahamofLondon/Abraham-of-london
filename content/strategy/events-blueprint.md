# Abraham of London — Events Blueprint (Rolling 1–5 Year Plan)

**Principle:** Clarity, Capital, Character.  
**Room standard:** Chatham (off the record).  
**Design:** Small rooms, high trust, practical standards.

---

## Pillars (Event Types)
1. **Salon** — curated conversation; 12–16 seats; 90 minutes.
2. **Workshop** — working session; 12–16 seats; 2–3 hours.
3. **Briefing** — principal update; 30–45 minutes; remote or in-room.
4. **Retreat** — 1–2 day deep work; 8–12 principals.
5. **Community** — invite-only dinners, stewardship forums.

---

## Annual Themes & Quarterly Arcs
- **Yearly theme (1)** sets tone (e.g., *Enduring Enterprise*).
- **Quarter arcs (4)**: *Clarity → Capital → Cadence → Character*.
- **Library alignment**: each quarter publishes 2–3 materials (notes/PDFs).

---

## Capacity & Cadence
- **Quarterly cadence:** 1 Salon, 1 Workshop, 1 Briefing (min).
- **Seat guardrails:** 12–16 seats, 85%+ attendance target.
- **Quality bar:** 9.0+ NPS, 80% “actionable within 7 days”.

---

## Governance (RACI)
**Roles**
- *Principal (A):* approves themes, standards, guests.  
- *Program Director (R/A):* owns calendar, OKRs, budget, QA.  
- *Content Lead (R):* briefs, MDX, materials, run-of-show.  
- *Ops Lead (R):* venue, invites, comms, hospitality.  
- *Partnerships (C):* co-hosts, sponsorship (guardrailed).  
- *Stewardship (R):* post-room follow-up, advisory pipeline.

**Decisions**
- Themes & pillars — *Principal/Director*  
- Room list — *Principal + Director*, privacy check by *Ops*  
- Budget, venues — *Director*  
- Standards (Chatham, devices) — *Principal*

---

## Cadences
- **Annual (Q4):** theme, budget, pillar targets (board pack).  
- **Quarterly (Q–1):** finalize rooms, materials plan, outreach map.  
- **Monthly:** run-sheet review; risk & readiness; stewardship list.  
- **Weekly (8-week runway):** checklist burn-down; confirmations.  
- **48–72 hrs pre:** final confirmations; room brief; seating chart.  
- **<24 hrs:** principal brief; ops pack; materials printed.  
- **+24 hrs post:** debrief, NPS, notes, follow-ups, repo updates.

---

## Guardrails (Budget & Quality)
- **Cost per seat (target/ceiling):** £90 / £140 (workshop), £60 / £100 (salon).  
- **Net margin goal:** breakeven on room; margin from advisory/follow-on.  
- **No sponsorship logos in room**; co-hosts approved by Principal only.

---

## KPIs (per quarter)
- Attendance rate ≥ **85%**
- NPS ≥ **9.0**
- “Actionable within 7 days” ≥ **80%**
- Advisory pipeline: **x** qualified conversations
- Materials: **≥ 3** new PDFs shipped; **≥ 500** downloads
- List growth: **+7–10%**
- Press: **0** (by design), referrals: **≥ 2** principal introductions

---

## 1–5 Year Milestones (Rolling)
**Year 1 — Pilot & Proof**
- 4 salons, 4 workshops, 4 briefings.
- Library v1: 10 core PDFs (cadence, comms, stewardship, decision).

**Year 2 — Scale & Systemise**
- Each pillar runs quarterly with rhythm.
- Stewardship CRM, referral flywheel, materials index/search.

**Year 3 — Syndicate & Partners**
- Co-hosted rooms with aligned principals (2–3 carefully curated).
- Fellowship seed (6–8 leaders; 6-month cadence).

**Year 4 — Institute**
- “Standards & Stewardship Institute” brand; curriculum map.
- Signature retreat; case compendium (de-identified).

**Year 5 — Legacy**
- Annual report (impact, standards, alumni).  
- Endowed fellowship; chapter playbook for other cities.

---

## Risk & Controls
- **Privacy breach:** guest NDA, transparent Chatham brief; device policy; small rooms.  
- **Quality drift:** content peer-review; post-mortems; standards checklist.  
- **Over-extension:** fixed cadence; no ad-hoc rooms without Director approval.  
- **Partner misfit:** values screen; veto right by Principal.

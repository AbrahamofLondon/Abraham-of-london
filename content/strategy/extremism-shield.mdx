# Tactical Response Guide

### 1. The Conviction vs. Coercion Pivot
"My message is exclusive (Christ alone), but my method is constrained (love and persuasion). Are you uncomfortable with my conviction, or can you point to a coercive action? Because if you can't, you're misusing the word 'extremist' to silence a dissenter."

### 2. The Founder Test
"When a Christian becomes violent, he is disobeying the life and commands of his Founder. When other systems become violent, they are often imitating the blueprint of theirs. Why are you conflating a deviation with a fulfillment?"

### 3. The Neurobiological Reality
"The ancient wisdom of the Cross teaches that growth only happens through the difficult thing we do not want to do. Modern science confirms this via the growth of the anterior mid-cingulate cortex. Calling the embrace of hardship 'extremism' is simply calling growth 'dangerous' because it threatens your comfort."

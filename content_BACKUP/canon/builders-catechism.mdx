# **The Builder’s Catechism**
## *A Systematic Q&A for Builders, Fathers & Reformers*

This is not inspiration.  
This is **instruction**.

This Catechism exists to clarify thought, harden resolve,  
and align the builder with order, purpose, and destiny.

Read it slowly.  
Return to it often.  
Live by it deliberately.

## **IV. FORMATION — MEMORY & TRANSMISSION**

**Q14. What is formation?**

---

## **IX. DESTINY — SOVEREIGNTY & OBEDIENCE**

**Q29. What is destiny?**

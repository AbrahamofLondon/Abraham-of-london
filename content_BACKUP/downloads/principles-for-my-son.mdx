## A Note From Your Father

My son,

I am writing these principles so that, whatever life throws at us, you will never be in doubt about **what I believe, what I pray for you, and how I expect you to walk as a man**.

These are not slogans. They are **anchors** for when life feels confusing, unfair or overwhelming.

---

## 1. Start With God, Not With Yourself

The world will tell you to "follow your heart."  
Your heart is important - but it is not your God.

Begin with:

- Who God is
- What He has said
- What He calls good and evil

When you start with God, you gain a **fixed reference point** in a shifting world.

---

## 2. Guard Your Integrity at All Costs

There are things you can lose and recover: money, deals, opportunities.  
There are things you cannot easily recover: **trust, honour, credibility**.

- Say what you mean.
- Do what you said you would do.
- If you fail, own it quickly and repair it fully.

I would rather see you **honest and struggling** than successful and crooked.

---

## 3. Honour Your Name and Your Word

Your name is not a logo. It is a **reputation built over years**.

- Do not sign what you do not intend to honour.
- Do not promise what you know you cannot deliver.
- Do not use people as stepping stones.

When people hear your name, let them think: _"I can trust this man."_

---

## 4. Work Hard, Work Smart, Rest Well

Laziness will quietly erode your potential.  
Workaholism will quietly erode your soul.

- Learn to **work hard** - with focus, discipline and excellence.
- Learn to **work smart** - prioritise, think, plan.
- Learn to **rest well** - sleep, take breaks, enjoy beauty and silence.

You are not a machine. You are a man created for **purpose, not just output**.

---

## 5. Take Responsibility, Do Not Play the Victim

Life will not always be fair. People will not always be kind. Systems will not always be just.

Still:

- Own your choices.
- Own your reactions.
- Own your next step.

You may not be responsible for **what happened to you**, but you are responsible for **what happens next**.

---

## 6. Choose Your Friends Carefully

The people you walk with will shape:

- Your habits
- Your decisions
- Your vision of what is "normal"

Walk with men who:

- Tell you the truth
- Challenge you when you drift
- Celebrate your growth without envy

Do not confuse **attention** with **loyalty**.

---

## 7. Honour Women, Protect the Vulnerable

How you treat women says a lot about your character.

- Never use charm to manipulate.
- Never use strength to intimidate.
- Never treat anyone as disposable.

Honour begins with how you speak, look and think.  
Treat every person as someone made in the image of God.

---

## 8. Learn to Handle Money Wisely

Money is a tool, not a master.

- Live below your means.
- Avoid unnecessary debt.
- Give generously and quietly.
- Save and invest with patience, not greed.

If you master your appetites, you will not be easily mastered by money.

---

## 9. Tell the Truth About Your Pain

Strong men are not those who never cry or never struggle.  
Strong men are those who **refuse to hide in silence and self-destruction**.

When you are overwhelmed:

- Speak to God honestly.
- Speak to someone you trust deeply.
- Ask for help before you collapse.

You never lose dignity by asking for wise help. You lose dignity by pretending until everything breaks.

---

## 10. Build for Legacy, Not Just for Today

Life is short. Eternity is long. People are watching even when you think they are not.

Ask yourself often:

- _"What am I building that will outlive me?"_
- _"What kind of story will my life tell about God, about manhood, about fatherhood?"_

I want you to live in such a way that **your children and their children** can thank God for the decisions you made.

---

## Final Word

My son,

You will make mistakes. So did I. So will every man you admire.  
What matters is that you **keep returning to truth, to God, and to who you are called to be.**

Whatever happens:

> _You are my son. I love you. I want you to stand, to build, and to walk without fear._

Your father.

# Canon Builder's Rule of Life

You cannot build something that endures on a life that is drifting.  
The Canon assumes that serious builders live by **rule**, not by impulse.

This framework is not a legalistic checklist. It is a **trellis**-a structure that allows life to grow in the right direction.

---

## 1. Non-Negotiable Morning Anchor (30-60 minutes)

Every day begins before you touch your phone.

**Components:**

1. **Stillness (3-5 minutes)**

   - Sit. Breathe. Acknowledge God's presence.
   - Pray: "Speak, Lord; your servant is listening."

2. **Scripture (10-20 minutes)**

   - Follow a reading plan that ties into the Canon Year One plan.
   - Read slowly. Mark verbs and commands.

3. **Canon Paragraph (3-5 minutes)**

   - Read one paragraph from any Canon volume or resource.
   - Ask: _"If I live this today, what changes?"_

4. **Intercession (10-15 minutes)**
   - Pray by **domains**:
     - Heart (character and affections)
     - House (family and household)
     - Hand (work and vocation)
     - Horizon (city, nation, Church)

Record one sentence in a notebook:

> "Today, obedience looks like ****\*\*****\_\_\_****\*\*****."

## 2. Daily Standards for Speech, Money, and Eyes

Canon builders set explicit daily lines:

- **Speech**

  - No gossip, no flattery, no needless complaint.
  - If you must confront, do it privately and directly.

- **Money**

  - Track every outgoing.
  - Tithe and generosity are pre-decided, not mood-driven.

- **Eyes**
  - No pornography. No lingering on images designed to inflame lust or covetousness.
  - Practise "bounce and bless": look away, pray a short blessing instead.

Write these into your rule. Review at night without excuses.

## 3. Weekly Canon Builder Rhythm

**Sabbath Block (Half or Full Day):**

- Cease from ordinary work.
- Engage in worship, rest, and relationships.
- Review the week:
  - Where did you obey quickly?
  - Where did you compromise?

**Stewardship Block (60-90 minutes):**

- Review:
  - Calendar for the coming week
  - Finances and giving
  - Commitments to people (mentoring, family, team)

Ask:

1. _What must be honoured?_
2. _What must be cancelled or delegated?_
3. _What must be started?_

---

## 4. Monthly Examination & Course Correction

Once a month, carve out **2-3 hours** alone.

Work through:

1. **Canon Alignment Questions**

   - Am I living as a **builder** or a **critic**?
   - Have I drifted into self-pity, entitlement, or cynicism?
   - Is my household becoming more ordered or more chaotic?

2. **Confession & Repentance**

   - Name specific sins and patterns.
   - Ask for cleansing and fresh wisdom.

3. **Re-commitment of Call**
   - Re-state, in writing, the call you believe God has placed on your life.
   - Adjust if necessary as light increases.

## 5. Rule of Life Template

Use this simple template to draft your personal Canon rule:

### Daily

- Morning anchor: ****\*\*\*\*****\_\_\_****\*\*\*\*****
- Midday check-in (5-10 min): **\*\***\_\_\_\_**\*\***
- Evening review (10-15 min): **\*\***\_\_\_\_**\*\***

### Weekly

- Sabbath pattern: ****\*\*\*\*****\_\_****\*\*\*\*****
- Stewardship block: ****\*\*****\_\_\_\_****\*\*****
- Service / hospitality rhythm: **\*\***\_\_**\*\***

### Monthly

- Examination day: ****\*\*\*\*****\_\_****\*\*\*\*****
- Key questions I will ask myself: \***\*\_\_\_\*\***

### Relational Guardrails

- Men I will be brutally honest with: **\_\_\_\_**
- Elders / mentors I will submit big decisions to: **\*\*\*\***\_\_\_**\*\*\*\***

## 6. Guarding Against Extremes

Two ditches threaten every rule of life:

1. **Legalism** - trusting the rule instead of the Lord.
2. **Licence** - abandoning the rule when it exposes your flesh.

The Canon path is different:

- Use the rule as a **tool**, not an identity.
- When you fail, **repent and resume**, not abandon.
- Let trusted people **see and challenge** your rule regularly.

> Builders are not defined by how often they never fall,  
> but by how quickly they rise, repent, and rebuild.

Write your rule. Live your rule.  
Then, when the storm comes, you will not discover who you are; you will simply reveal what you have been practising all along.

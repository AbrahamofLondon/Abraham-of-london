Numbness is not peace.

It's a ceasefire.

It's what you choose  
when you've been disappointed enough times  
that feeling deeply starts to look stupid.

So you flatten your emotions.

No highs.  
No lows.  
Just functioning.

Numbness feels safe because:

- you can't be hurt if you don't hope  
- you can't be embarrassed if you don't want  
- you can't be disappointed if you don't expect

But the cost is brutal:

You don't just numb pain.  
You numb joy.

Here's the challenge:

Joy requires vulnerability.

And if vulnerability has been punished in your life,  
you will treat joy like a trap.

You'll keep waiting for the "catch."

This week, practice safe joy:

- one meal eaten slowly  
- one walk with your shoulders relaxed  
- one moment of laughter without immediately "getting back to work"

And when the guilt tries to interrupt, tell it the truth:

Restoration is not laziness.  
Joy is not betrayal.  
Peace is not suspicious.

You're not childish for wanting to feel alive again.

You're healing.

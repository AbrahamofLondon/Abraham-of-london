You know how to walk into a room  
like you belong there.

You've rehearsed the handshake, the eye contact,  
the perfectly timed laugh.

People call you "confident".  
If only they knew how much work that word costs you.

Confidence, the way the world sells it,  
is often just anxiety with better packaging.

You've learned:

- How to speak before you feel ready.  
- How to look unbothered while you're panicking.  
- How to take up space while disappearing inside.

You're not an imposter.  
You're just exhausted from playing the part.

Real confidence is quieter, almost boring:

- You can say *"I don't know"*  
  without your world collapsing.  
- You can say *"That's not for me"*  
  without drafting a 3-page justification.  
- You can be wrong  
  without becoming worthless.

Confidence is not a costume you put on.  
It's the peace of knowing you're not performing for a jury.

This week, practice **unpolished honesty** once:

- Admit a gap in your knowledge out loud.  
- Ask a "basic" question in a room that intimidates you.  
- Share one fear with someone safe.

Not everything powerful has to look polished.

Sometimes the most confident thing you can do  
is let people meet the version of you  
who hasn't fully figured it out yet.

Doctrine matters.

Truth matters.

But doctrine can become a hiding place  
for people who are scared of intimacy with God.

Because doctrine is controllable.  
God is not.

---

You can master theology  
and still be spiritually distant.

You can win debates  
and still be empty.

You can quote Scripture  
and still be avoiding God Himself.

Here's the uncomfortable reality:

Some people use doctrine  
to avoid surrender.

Because surrender means God can ask for things:

- forgiveness you don't want to give  
- obedience that costs reputation  
- integrity that removes comfort

Doctrine lets you stay informed  
without being transformed.

This week, shift from information to encounter:

- pray without performing  
- read one Gospel passage slowly  
- ask: "Lord, what do You want from me right now?"

Not a lecture.  
A response.

Truth is not meant to be displayed.  
Truth is meant to be lived.

And God is not a concept to be mastered.  
He is a King to be obeyed - and a Father to be known.

Some people can't rest  
without feeling guilty.

Others can't rest  
without feeling afraid.

Because when you slow down,  
you start to hear what you've been outrunning.

---

Rest becomes dangerous when:

- Silence brings back memories.  
- Stillness brings back feelings.  
- Pausing makes you aware of how tired you really are.

So you keep moving.

Not because you're ambitious,  
but because you're avoiding yourself.

---

This is not condemnation.  
It's clarity.

You don't need a harsher schedule.  
You need healing.

Try this tonight:

- Sit still for five minutes.  
- No phone. No music. No productivity.  
- Breathe and notice what rises.

If anxiety rises, don't panic.  
Just name it.

Because what you refuse to face  
will always demand to be chased.

Rest isn't dangerous.  
Unprocessed pain is.

And your body is not your enemy.  
It's your messenger.

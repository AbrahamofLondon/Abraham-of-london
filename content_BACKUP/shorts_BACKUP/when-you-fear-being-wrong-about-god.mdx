Some doubts aren't rebellious.  
They're terrified.

Because if you were wrong about God,  
what else collapses?

Your morality.  
Your meaning.  
Your hope.  
Your suffering.

So you keep questions locked away  
and call it "faith."

But faith isn't fragile.

If truth is truth,  
it can survive investigation.

The fear isn't that God is weak.  
The fear is that you've built your life  
on a version of God you never actually tested.

Here's the mature posture:

Ask the hard questions  
without becoming cynical.

Seek truth  
without becoming arrogant.

Hold conviction  
without pretending you're omniscient.

This week, do something brave:

- write down your biggest fear about God  
- not the polite fear - the real one  
- then bring it into prayer honestly

God is not offended by sincerity.

If anything, He's offended by the religious theatre  
we use to avoid Him.

Truth can handle pressure.  
And so can the God of truth.

You keep feeling behind.

Behind in money.  
Behind in marriage.  
Behind in career.  
Behind in life.

But behind *who*?

A curated timeline?  
A filtered photo?  
A person you’ve never actually lived with?

Comparison is a thief with good manners.

It doesn’t scream.  
It whispers:

“You should be further.”

And you believe it  
even when your circumstances were harder,  
your responsibilities heavier,  
your path different.

Tonight, do this:

- list what you survived in the last 12 months  
- then ask: “Would I judge someone else for recovering slowly?”

Probably not.

So stop punishing yourself for being human.

You are not behind.

You are becoming.

And that takes time — the kind you can’t rush without breaking.

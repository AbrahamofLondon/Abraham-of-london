Having standards is good.

Low standards ruin lives.

But there's a trap:  
sometimes "standards" become camouflage for fear.

You don't just want quality people.  
You want safety.

So you raise the bar so high  
nobody can reach you.

Then you tell yourself:

- "People are disappointing."  
- "I'm fine alone."  
- "I'm just selective."

But deep down, you're not fine.  
You're protected.

---

Here's the uncomfortable question:

Are your standards filtering out chaos -  
or filtering out intimacy?

Because real relationships require tolerance:

- for imperfect delivery  
- for misunderstanding  
- for human error

If your standard is "never disappoint me,"  
you're not looking for a person.  
You're looking for an environment you can control.

This week, keep your standards -  
but check your walls:

- Identify one standard that is really a fear.  
- Practice vulnerability once with someone safe.  
- Allow one person to be human without disqualifying them.

Discernment is wisdom.  
But isolation is not a virtue.

Sometimes the thing you call "high standards"  
is just loneliness with good grammar.

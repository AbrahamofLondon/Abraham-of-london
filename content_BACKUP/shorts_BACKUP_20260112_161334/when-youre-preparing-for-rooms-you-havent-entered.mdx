Some seasons feel like nothing is happening.

No applause.  
No visible progress.  
Just quiet work and quiet waiting.

And you start wondering if you missed your moment.

---

But preparation rarely feels like destiny.

It feels like repetition.  
Like obscurity.  
Like doing the same thing again  
with no guarantee it will matter.

---

Here's what people forget:

Rooms you pray to enter  
often require a version of you  
that doesn't exist yet.

Not because God is cruel,  
but because access without capacity  
becomes disaster.

---

So you learn:

- discipline without motivation  
- humility without recognition  
- courage without a cheering crowd

That's not punishment.  
That's leadership formation.

This week, stop despising preparation:

- Treat your current responsibility like it's sacred.  
- Tighten your craft.  
- Clean up what your future can't afford to carry.

When the door opens,  
you won't have time to become ready.

And when you finally enter that room,  
you'll realise the waiting wasn't wasted -  
it was shaping.

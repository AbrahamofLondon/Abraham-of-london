Waiting can make you bitter.

Because you’re not just waiting for a thing.  
You’re waiting for relief.

For validation.  
For stability.  
For the next chapter.

And it feels like God is taking His time  
with your life.

Here’s the perspective we avoid:

Delay is not always denial.

Sometimes it’s:

- protection from a door you’re romanticising  
- preparation for responsibility you can’t yet carry  
- correction because your path is misaligned

And yes — sometimes it’s simply mystery.

But bitterness in waiting is dangerous.

It makes you interpret everything as punishment.  
It makes you forget past provision.  
It makes you stop praying honestly.

This week, do one mature thing:

Ask God one clean question:

“Lord, what is this season building in me?”

Then answer honestly:

- patience?  
- humility?  
- discipline?  
- detachment?  
- trust?

The waiting is not wasted  
unless you waste it.

Even delays can be holy  
when you stop fighting them and start learning.

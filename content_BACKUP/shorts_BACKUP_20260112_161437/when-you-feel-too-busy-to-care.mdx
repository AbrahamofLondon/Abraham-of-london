There is a special kind of exhaustion where you're not just tired of work -  
you're tired of **caring**.

You care about your family, your future, your health, your faith...  
you just don't have any bandwidth left to prove it not even to yourself.

So you do the same thing as everyone else:

You throw more energy at the urgent stuff  
and quietly hope the important stuff will wait.

---

Here's the problem:

The urgent things **shout**.  
The important things **whisper**.

And over time, the whispers start sounding like guilt.

---

Instead of promising to "reorganise your whole life", try this:

- Identify **one thing** that actually matters to you.  
- Give it **fifteen undistracted minutes** in the next 24 hours.  
- Treat that slot as non-negotiable as a meeting with your boss.

Fifteen minutes won't fix your life.  
But it will do something far more dangerous:

It will remind you  
that you are not just a calendar  
being dragged behind other people's priorities.

You are still allowed  
to **choose**.

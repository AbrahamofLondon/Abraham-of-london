Most people don’t fear sin.

They fear obedience  
that costs them comfort.

Because radical obedience isn’t dramatic.

It’s not always “mission trips” and “big moves.”

Sometimes it’s:

- telling the truth when lying would be easier  
- keeping your integrity when it costs money  
- cutting off what feeds your lust  
- forgiving when you’d rather punish  
- choosing holiness when no one is watching

Here’s the blunt truth:

You can’t serve God casually.

Not if you want real transformation.

Comfort Christianity produces  
comfortable people  
with no power.

This week, choose one uncomfortable obedience:

- end a compromise  
- repent quickly  
- make restitution  
- do what you know is right without announcing it

Radical faith is not for show.

It’s for freedom.

And freedom always costs something.

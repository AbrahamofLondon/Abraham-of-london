Weekends shouldn’t feel like oxygen.

If Monday feels like suffocation,  
that’s not “adult life.”

That’s misalignment.

Living for weekends often means:

- your work drains you with no restoration  
- your routines are built around escape  
- your weekdays are endured, not lived

And you’ve normalised it  
because everyone around you is also miserable.

Misery loves company.  
That doesn’t make it wise.

This week, don’t quit everything impulsively.

Do something smarter:

- locate one daily joy (small, consistent, real)  
- adjust one boundary at work  
- reclaim one hour of your day for your soul

If your whole life is a countdown to Friday,  
you don’t need a vacation.

You need a redesign.

Because your life is not meant to be 5/7 suffering.

There’s a kind of fatigue  
that only comes from one-sided effort.

You initiate.  
You apologise.  
You explain.  
You repair.

And they… receive.

At first you call it patience.

Then it becomes a pattern.

And then you realise  
you’re not in a relationship —  
you’re in a maintenance role.

Here’s the hard truth:

Love doesn’t require you to beg for basic effort.

Reciprocity is not a luxury.  
It’s the minimum.

If you have to keep proving your value,  
you’re dealing with someone  
who likes being loved  
more than they like loving.

This week, pull back slightly.

Not to punish them.  
To reveal the truth.

Stop doing one thing you always do.

If the relationship collapses  
when you stop carrying it,  
you didn’t lose love.

You lost a burden.

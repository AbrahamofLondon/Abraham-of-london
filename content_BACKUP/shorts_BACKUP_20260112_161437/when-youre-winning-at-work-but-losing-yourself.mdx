You're getting it done.

Deadlines met.  
Metrics up.  
Emails answered.

People say you're "on fire".

But the truth is uglier:  
you're burning.

Work is a convenient religion.

It gives you:

- Structure when your inner life is messy.  
- Praise when you feel uncertain.  
- Status when you feel powerless.

And if you're not careful,  
you'll build a career as a substitute for identity.

Here's the confrontation:

If your job disappeared tomorrow,  
who would you be?

Not what would you do - who would you be?

If that question makes you panic,  
you're not ambitious.  
You're attached.

This week:

- Take one hour that cannot be monetised.  
- Do something that restores you with no audience.  
- Say no once to prove you still have a spine.

Work is a tool.  
Not a throne.

And if your success costs your soul,  
it's not success.  
It's a well-decorated loss.

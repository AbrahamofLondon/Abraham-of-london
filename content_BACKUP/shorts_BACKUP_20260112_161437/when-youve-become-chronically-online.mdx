Being online is normal now.

But “normal” is not a moral category.

You can be normal  
and still be unwell.

Chronically online people have symptoms:

- short attention span  
- constant outrage  
- shallow joy  
- restless boredom  
- difficulty being present

You’re consuming everyone’s life  
and neglecting your own.

Here’s the hard truth:

If you spend your best mental energy  
reacting to strangers,  
you will have nothing left  
for your real assignment.

And that’s not an accident.

Distraction is an industry.

This week, reclaim your mind:

- remove one app for 7 days  
- set one “no screen” hour daily  
- replace scrolling with something embodied: walk, journal, pray, cook

Your life is not in your feed.

Your life is where your attention goes.

Spend it like it matters.

[functions]
  directory = "netlify/functions" # This would mean your functions are at /src/netlify/functions
  # If your functions are not in src/netlify/functions but maybe at the repo root's netlify/functions,
  # then you'd need to adjust this (e.g., if functions are at /netlify/functions, Netlify might
  # need a full path or a different setup, but let's stick to simple if possible).
  # For now, let's assume if 'src' is the base, functions are relative to 'src'.

"Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it." – Proverbs 22:6

*O.J.A-Y won't inherit fear. He'll inherit clarity, conviction, and a legacy rooted in purpose.*

Here's what I'm teaching him:
- Think critically.
- Lead with humility.
- Fight spiritually.
- Honor truth—no matter how unpopular.

The world doesn't define manhood. The Word does.

And I will not fail in passing it on.

### The Foundation of Fearless Fatherhood

Fear is a thief. It steals peace, paralyzes purpose, and pales potential. Many men today are fathering from a place of fear—fear of failure, fear of judgment, fear of losing control. But true fatherhood, as ordained by God, is a position of fearless leadership. It's about cultivating character, instilling conviction, and constructing a legacy that transcends generations.

### Principles Over Preferences

In a rapidly changing world, trends come and go. But principles endure. I am committed to teaching O.J.A-Y (and any other son I am blessed with) a set of timeless truths that will equip him to navigate chaos with clarity.

1.  **Think Critically:** The ability to discern truth from deception is paramount. I'm teaching him to question narratives, analyze information, and form his own well-reasoned conclusions, not just echo popular opinion. This means engaging with complex ideas, challenging assumptions (including mine), and seeking wisdom beyond fleeting headlines.
2.  **Lead with Humility:** True strength isn't expressed through arrogance or dominance, but through servant leadership. Humility acknowledges God's sovereignty and our dependence on Him. It fosters a willingness to learn, to admit mistakes, and to serve others sacrificially. A humble leader doesn't demand respect; he earns it.
3.  **Fight Spiritually:** We are not battling flesh and blood, but principalities and powers (Ephesians 6:12). I am teaching him that the most important battles are fought on his knees, in prayer, and with the Word of God as his sword. Spiritual warfare isn't abstract; it's intensely practical for daily living.
4.  **Honor Truth—No Matter How Unpopular:** In a world that often demonizes truth-tellers, I want him to be a man of unwavering integrity. Truth is not relative; it is absolute, rooted in God's character. Standing for truth, even when it costs you, is the ultimate act of courage and faithfulness.

### Legacy Rooted in Purpose

My father taught me about hard work and provision. I honuor that. But my legacy for O.J.A-Y goes deeper. It’s about passing on a blueprint for life that equips him to discover his God-given purpose and live it out fearlessly.

He won't inherit a spirit of timidity, but of power, love, and a sound mind (2 Timothy 1:7). He will inherit a conviction that his identity is in Christ, not in the world's shifting sands. He will inherit a clear understanding of his role as a man, a leader, and potentially, a father himself.

This isn't just theory; it's lived out daily. It's in the conversations we have, the actions I take, and the unwavering commitment to present him with a father who is striving to walk in integrity and purpose.

The world doesn't define manhood. The Word does.

And I will not fail in passing it on.

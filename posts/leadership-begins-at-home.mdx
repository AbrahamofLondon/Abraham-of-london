Iâ€™ve spent a good portion of my life reflecting on what makes societies flourish and what causes them to rot from within. Iâ€™ve seen power up close. Iâ€™ve lived under governments that worked and ones that failed. But more than anything, my own journey has taught me that the fate of a nation is not written in its parliaments or presidential palaces. Itâ€™s written in the unseen corners of ordinary homes.



As a man who has made mistakes, endured loss, fought systems, and still stands with my faith intact, Iâ€™ve come to one unshakable conviction: *leadership begins with self, is forged in the family, and blooms into society.*



You see, I was raised by parents who, while not perfect, understood the gravity of responsibility. My late father, *David Akindele Adaramola, was a teacher before anything else. Not just by profession, but by purpose. He raised us with discipline, values, and an unspoken challenge: **be a person who leaves things better than you found them.*



That simple ethic shaped me. And yet, like many, Iâ€™ve had to confront the gap between the values we profess and the choices we make when life tests us. But this I now know for sure: before we can talk about building businesses, movements, or even nations, *we must first master the government of the self.*



> "He who rules his spirit is better than he who captures a city." â€” *Proverbs 16:32*



That verse haunts me in a good way. It reminds me that self-leadership is not glamorous. It's not loud. It's daily, private, gritty. It's choosing integrity when no one is watching. It's treating others with respect when there's nothing to gain. It's refusing to pass trauma and dysfunction down to your children just because it was passed to you.



When I look at my son, I am reminded that I am not just raising a boy. *I am raising a future man, a potential leader, an agent of change.* The family is not just where love lives; *it is where civilization is discipled.*



History backs this up. Every enduring civilization was anchored on the strength of its families. When the family crumbles, society is not far behind. *Weak men produce weak homes. Weak homes produce weak societies. And suddenly, weâ€™re all wondering why the world is on fire.*



As Christians, we don't have the luxury of outsourcing this work. Jesus said:



> "You are the salt of the earth... the light of the world... a city on a hill." â€” *Matthew 5:13-14*



That's not a suggestion. *That's an identity.* But light that is hidden in self-indulgence, in broken homes, in unmastered appetites, is no light at all.



This is why my lifeâ€™s mission, my writing, my work, even my upcoming books, all orbit around one central reality: *the personal is political, the private is public, and the home is the first battlefield of leadership.*



We cannot fix our countries if we cannot fix our homes. We cannot raise giants if we remain moral dwarfs inside. It starts with us â€” how we lead ourselves, how we raise our children, how we love with integrity.



If there is any revolution the world desperately needs, *it is not the noisy kind that starts in the streets. It is the quiet revolution that begins in the heart, matures in the home, and spills over into the world.*



Thatâ€™s the city on a hill I want to build. *And by Godâ€™s grace, I will.*

# The Brotherhood Code — Starter Kit (One-Page Covenant)

**Purpose:** Break cycles of absence by a covenant of presence and integrity.

---

## The Code (Read Aloud & Sign)
1. **Show up.** Weekly touchpoint. *No ghosts.*
2. **Tell the truth.** Confess before you **collapse**.
3. **Carry weight.** Pray, call, turn up at the door.
4. **Protect families.** No gossip. No shortcuts. **Cover, don’t expose.**
5. **Build together.** Study, train, serve. **Produce — not just post.**

## Meeting Rhythm (90 minutes)
- **45 min — Scripture + Discussion** (foundation)
- **30 min — Formation** (habits, money, marriage, parenting)
- **15 min — Intercession** (names, needs, next steps)

---

## Roles (Rotate Monthly)
- **Convener:** space + reminder
- **Timekeeper:** guards the clock
- **Scribe:** captures 1–3 actions per man
- **Chaplain:** opens/closes in prayer; coordinates care

---

## Accountability Stack
1) **Facts first:** what/when/impact (no adjectives)  
2) **Heart next:** feelings & beliefs in the moment  
3) **Hope last:** next right step by Friday + partner

---

## Red Flags (Deal with Fast)
Chronic lateness w/o ownership, secrecy, triangulation, spiritual one‑upmanship.

## Signatures (90-Day Pilot)

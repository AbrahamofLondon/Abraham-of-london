    </header>

    <blockquote>
        "Let not your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me."
        <strong>— John 14:1</strong>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>The Context</h2>
        <p>Jesus speaks these words on the night before His crucifixion. The disciples are confused, anxious, and about to lose their Teacher. Into their chaos, Jesus offers four pillars of comfort that remain unshaken for every believer:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Assurance</strong> of a place prepared (vv. 1-6)</li>
            <li><strong>The way</strong> revealed through Him (vv. 6-11)</li>
            <li><strong>The Helper</strong> promised (vv. 15-26)</li>
            <li><strong>Peace</strong> given, not as the world gives (v. 27)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Key Verses & Reflections</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Assurance: "I Go to Prepare a Place for You" (vv. 1-4)</h3>
        <span class="scripture-ref">John 14:1-3</span>
        <blockquote>
            "Let not your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me. In my Father's house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also."
        </blockquote>
        
        <div class="reflection-box">
            <strong>Reflection:</strong>
            <p>Jesus doesn't promise that life will be painless. He promises <strong>presence</strong>. Your anxiety about tomorrow, your fear of loss, your uncertainty—none of it changes this: <strong>He has gone ahead to secure your place.</strong> You are not wandering. You are being led home.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="application-box">
            <strong>Application:</strong>
            <p>When anxiety rises, ask: <em>Am I trusting Jesus with my future, or am I demanding control?</em> Write down one fear and speak John 14:1 over it.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>2. The Way: "I Am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life" (vv. 5-7)</h3>
        <span class="scripture-ref">John 14:6</span>
        <blockquote>
            "Jesus said to him, 'I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.'"
        </blockquote>
        
        <div class="reflection-box">
            <strong>Reflection:</strong>
            <p>This is not religious exclusivism—it's rescue. Jesus doesn't point to a path; <strong>He is the path.</strong> He doesn't share truth; <strong>He is the truth.</strong> He doesn't give life; <strong>He is life.</strong> Every other way leads to a dead end. This one leads to the Father.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="application-box">
            <strong>Application:</strong>
            <p>Are you trying to earn your way to God through morality, religious activity, or self-improvement? Repent. Trust Christ alone. Stop performing. Start resting.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>3. Greater Works Through Faith (vv. 12-14)</h3>
        <span class="scripture-ref">John 14:12</span>
        <blockquote>
            "Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I am going to the Father."
        </blockquote>
        
        <div class="reflection-box">
            <strong>Reflection:</strong>
            <p>Jesus ascends to the Father, sends the Spirit, and mobilizes the church globally. The "greater works" aren't greater in <em>quality</em> (we can't outdo Christ), but in <em>scope</em>—the Gospel goes to every nation. You are part of that mission. Your obedience, powered by the Spirit, advances the Kingdom.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="application-box">
            <strong>Application:</strong>
            <p>What is one act of obedience you've been delaying? Pray. Act. Trust the Spirit to work through you.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>4. The Helper: The Spirit of Truth (vv. 15-26)</h3>
        <span class="scripture-ref">John 14:16-17</span>
        <blockquote>
            "And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you."
        </blockquote>
        
        <span class="scripture-ref">John 14:26</span>
        <blockquote>
            "But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you."
        </blockquote>
        
        <div class="reflection-box">
            <strong>Reflection:</strong>
            <p>You are not alone. The same Spirit that raised Christ from the dead <strong>lives in you</strong> (Romans 8:11). He convicts, teaches, comforts, empowers, and reminds you of Jesus' words. When you don't know how to pray, He intercedes (Romans 8:26). When you're weak, He strengthens (Ephesians 3:16). When you're confused, He guides (John 16:13).</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="application-box">
            <strong>Application:</strong>
            <p>Stop trying to live the Christian life in your own strength. <strong>Depend on the Spirit.</strong> Start your day with this prayer:</p>
            <p><em>"Holy Spirit, I cannot do this. Lead me. Empower me. Remind me of Jesus."</em></p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>5. Peace: Not as the World Gives (v. 27)</h3>
        <span class="scripture-ref">John 14:27</span>
        <blockquote>
            "Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid."
        </blockquote>
        
        <div class="reflection-box">
            <strong>Reflection:</strong>
            <p>The world's peace depends on circumstances: good health, financial security, stable relationships. <strong>Christ's peace is independent of circumstances.</strong> It's the peace of being reconciled to God, knowing you're held by Him, and trusting His sovereignty even when life is chaos.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="application-box">
            <strong>Application:</strong>
            <p>Where are you chasing the world's peace (comfort, control, approval) instead of resting in Christ's peace? Confess it. Choose trust over control.</p>

        <h2>How to Run This Track</h2>
        <p>This is not a devotional to read once and forget. It's a <strong>field manual</strong> for when your heart is troubled. Use it like this:</p>
        
        <h3>Daily Practice (5-10 minutes)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Read the chapter</strong> — John 14 in full (takes 3 minutes)</li>
            <li><strong>Pick one verse</strong> — Let it sit with you throughout the day</li>
            <li><strong>Pray it back</strong> — Use the verse as your prayer language</li>
            <li><strong>Act on it</strong> — One concrete step of obedience</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Weekly Reflection (15-20 minutes)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Review the five pillars:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Assurance (vv. 1-4)</li>
                    <li>The Way (vv. 5-7)</li>
                    <li>Greater Works (vv. 12-14)</li>
                    <li>The Helper (vv. 15-26)</li>
                    <li>Peace (v. 27)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Journal these questions:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Where am I anxious instead of trusting?</li>
                    <li>Am I trying to earn my way instead of resting in Christ?</li>
                    <li>Am I depending on the Spirit or my own strength?</li>
                    <li>What does obedience look like this week?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Pray with a brother</strong> — Share one verse that challenged you</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Memory Verses</h2>
        <p>Commit these to memory. Write them on cards. Speak them when anxiety rises.</p>
        
        <div class="memory-verse">
            <span class="scripture-ref">John 14:1</span>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Closing Charge</h2>
        <p>Jesus spoke John 14 into the chaos of Maundy Thursday—the night before His death. The disciples didn't understand. They were terrified. But He gave them what they needed: <strong>not answers, but Himself.</strong></p>
        
        <p>You don't need more information. You need more of Jesus.<br>
        You don't need a better plan. You need to trust the One who holds the plan.<br>
        You don't need to fix yourself. You need to believe He has already secured your place.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-weight: 600; margin-top: 24px;">Start with the heart. End with action.</p>

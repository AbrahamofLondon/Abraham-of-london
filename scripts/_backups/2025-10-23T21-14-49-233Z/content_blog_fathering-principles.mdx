Hell inherit **clarity, conviction, and a legacy rooted in purpose**. Heres what Im teaching himand living in front of him. <PullLine> Im raising a man, not a moment. </PullLine> <Rule /> ## TL;DR What Im Forming - **Think critically.** Ask better questions; prefer wisdom over noise. - **Lead with humility.** Strength without pride. Repent quickly; forgive fully. - **Fight spiritually.** We battle powers, not peoplepray, fast, guard your mind, wield the Word. - **Honour truth even when it costs.** Integrity is expensivepay it gladly. <Callout tone="key" title="One move today"> Pick one principle, say it aloud at the table tonight, and choose a micro-action to prove it. </Callout> <Rule /> ## Principles Over Preferences Trends fade. **Principles build families.** 1. **Identity before activity.** Who you are in God anchors what you do in life. 2. **Standards before feelings.** Feelings follow formation. Build disciplines that carry you when emotion wont. 3. **Order before speed.** Pace kills without structure. Put first things firstfaith, family, work**. 4. **Stewardship before status.** Money and titles dont raise sons. **Time, presence, and wisdom** do. 5. **Courage before comfort.** Say the hard thing. Do the right thing. Walk the narrow road. <Note tone="info" title="Daily micro-rule (8 minutes)"> 60s room reset 10 push-ups $\times$ 3 read one proverb aloud send one encouragement text to your child or spouse. </Note> <Rule /> ## Legacy on Purpose My father taught **provision**; Im adding **formation**mind, spirit, character. I want a son who can build nations because he first learned to **govern himself**. <PullLine> Manhood isnt defined by culture. Its defined by the Word. Thats the inheritance. </PullLine> <Verse cite="Micah 6:8"> He has shown you, O man, what is good: to act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with your God. </Verse> <Rule /> ## Further Reading & Tools - **Court-season clarity:** *Reclaiming the Narrative* blog/reclaiming-the-narrative](/blog/reclaiming-the-narrative) - **Build your band of brothers:** *The Brotherhood Code* blog/the-brotherhood-code](/blog/the-brotherhood-code) - **Lead from the inside out:** *Leadership Begins at Home* blog/leadership-begins-at-home](/blog/leadership-begins-at-home) **Downloads (print-ready):** - **Practical Pack (Family Court):** [/downloads/Fathers_in_Family_Court_Practical_Pack.pdf](/downloads/Fathers_in_Family_Court_Practical_Pack.pdf) - **Brotherhood Starter Kit:** [/downloads/Brotherhood_Starter_Kit.pdf](/downloads/Brotherhood_Starter_Kit.pdf) - **Leader Guide First 4 Weeks:** [/downloads/Brotherhood_Leader_Guide_4_Weeks.pdf](/downloads/Brotherhood_Leader_Guide_4_Weeks.pdf) <Rule /> <Note tone="key" title="Build with Us"> Share this with a friend and start the conversation at your table.

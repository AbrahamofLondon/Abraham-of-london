# Christianity Is Not Extremism - It Is the Light That Built the World

Why does the public square so quickly label Christianity **"extremist"**-flattening distinctions as if all faiths were interchangeable? Words matter. So do **origins**, **means**, and **fruits**.

This is not an attack on neighbours of any creed. Christians are commanded to love every neighbour (_Luke 10:27_) and honour all people (_1 Peter 2:17_). This is a fatherly confession: **Christianity is not extremism**. It is the good news that **Jesus Christ is Lord**, and that in Him there is forgiveness, life, and a new way to be human.

<Rule />

## 1) Origins Matter: The Founder Is the Message

Christianity stands or falls with **Jesus Christ**-promised, incarnate, crucified, risen, reigning.

<PullLine>The Founder **is** the message (*John 14:6*). The Gospel advances by witness and costly love, **not coercion**.</PullLine>

- Our centre is **person**, not party.
- Our proof is **resurrection**, not rage.
- Our method is **preaching, service, and sacrificial love**, not compulsion.

<Rule />

## 2) Fruits Matter: The Legacy of the Light

<Verse cite="Matthew 7:16">By their fruits you will know them.</Verse>

Where the Gospel roots, hospitals, universities, literacy, care for the poor, and the _imago Dei_ basis for human dignity flourish. Christians fail; **repentance** is our corrective. The standard is not us-but **Him**.

- **Human dignity** from the image of God
- **Mercy institutions** (hospitals, relief, orphan care)
- **Learning & language** (schools, translation, universities)
- **Reform movements** sparked by conscience (slavery abolition, prison reform)

<Caption>Failures are real; **repentance** is how the Church returns to her Lord.</Caption>

<Rule />

## 3) What "Radical" Really Means

If "radical" means **rooted** (from _radix_, meaning root), then yes-Christianity is radical. The early church "turned the world upside down" (_Acts 17:6_) through proclamation, **service**, and **sacrifice**. Our revolution is **cross-shaped**-the power to lay down our lives for our enemies, not take theirs.

<Rule />

## 4) On Islam-And Neighbours We Love

Discussion often flattens distinctions. From a Christian confession:

- **Jesus is God the Son**; Islam denies this.
- The Gospel spreads by **preaching and repentance**-faith is never compelled.
- **Scripture** forms Christian ethics and corrects our failures.

<Note tone="key" title="Contend without contempt">
  We contend with **ideas**, not with **people** (*2 Cor. 10:5*). Our posture is invitation: *Come to Christ and live.* Love your neighbour. Tell the truth. Keep your heart clean.
</Note>

<Rule />

## 5) Fathers, Stand Firm: No Tepid Compromise

I'm raising **O-J-A-Y** to carry light without apology. If culture calls obedience "extreme," so be it. Tepid compromise is worse.

<PullLine subtle>• **Scripture before screens** · **Prayer before plans** · **Holiness before hype** · **Craft before clout** · **Courage with kindness**</PullLine>

**House rule (weekly):**

- Read the **Sermon on the Mount** aloud as a family (Matt 5-7).
- One act of mercy together (visit, call, give, serve).
- One hospitality moment (invite in a neighbour who believes differently).
- Review speech: **No contempt**; truth + tenderness only.

<Rule />

## 6) The Call: Exclusive Truth, Inclusive Grace

The Gospel is exclusive because truth is exclusive (_Acts 4:12_)-yet gloriously inclusive:

<Verse cite="Romans 10:13">Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.</Verse>

<PullLine>**Repent and live** (*Acts 3:19-20*). Christ is the Light of the world (*John 8:12*). As for our house, **we will serve the Lord** (*Joshua 24:15*).</PullLine>

<Rule />

## Practice: A Father's 7-Day Witness

- **Day 1 - Word:** Read John 1. Note one line to live.
- **Day 2 - Prayer:** 10 minutes for your child's courage and compassion.
- **Day 3 - Craft:** Make something excellent (meal, essay, deck) "as unto the Lord."
- **Day 4 - Mercy:** Give privately; don't post it.
- **Day 5 - Hospitality:** Share a table with someone who disagrees with you. Listen well.
- **Day 6 - Courage:** Speak one gracious truth you've avoided.
- **Day 7 - Rest:** Worship. Put your phone away for three hours. Delight in God.

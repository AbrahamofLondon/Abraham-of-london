00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
If men can protect… why does God allow?

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,000
I’ve survived bullets.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I left my body and came back to life.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I’ve buried siblings, a father, and friends.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I know pain — and I know God’s faithfulness.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
But Charlie is gone at 31 — a father of two.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
If men can shield, is God less resourceful?

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I’m not doubting God. I’m wrestling with Him.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Truth matters because lies destroy. Fathers must engage.
